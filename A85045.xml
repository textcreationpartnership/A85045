            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> ſaith, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is not, becauſe they appear <hi>unregenerate,</hi> but becauſe a <hi>ſcandalous</hi> life is contrary to the very <hi>outward profeſſion</hi> of the faith.</p>
            <p>But may I have leave to demand, how contrary? certainly not ſo contrary to it, but that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with it; otherwiſe a ſcandalous <hi>Profeſſour</hi> of the faith, would be a <hi>contradiction,</hi> and the very ground of the queſtion is gone. Indeed here is <hi>practice</hi> contrary to <hi>profeſſion,</hi> but not <hi>profeſſion</hi> contrary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and practice contrary to profeſſion may conſiſt with <hi>profeſsion, for they profeſſe to know God, though in works they deny him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118938:6"/>
            <p> If it be replied, that a ſcandalous life is contrary to the <hi>faith</hi> profeſſed, and ſo the <hi>profeſſion</hi> appears <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit;</hi> I crave leave to ask once more, whether faith here be taken <hi>objectivè,</hi> or <hi>ſubjectivè;</hi> if <hi>objectivè,</hi> for the <hi>doctrine</hi> profeſſed, or the Will of God revealed to be beleeved; then it may ſtill be affirmed that the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of the Scripture, or an outward owning of the Will and Word of God is not inconſiſtent with a <hi>converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> contrary thereunto; then why may not ſuch whoſe practice is contrary either to their profeſſion, or to the Scripture, which they yet profeſſe be received by the Church, if no other <hi>reaſon</hi> but this be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able?</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid that a ſcandalous life is contrary to the faith, <hi>in ſenſu formali, vel ſubjectivo;</hi> and that a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed converſation declareth that the Profeſſor doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as he profeſſeth, and is to be rejected therefore, as a counterfeit: Once more, I demand, whether this faith profeſſed, be conſidered as ſaving, or as common? if as ſaving, then Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> his cauſe is yeelded, who is now oppoſing Reverend Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> with this aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that wicked men are not to be rejected <hi>formally,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their wickedneſſe is a ſigne of unregeneracy, but <hi>materially,</hi> becauſe it is contrary to the profeſſion of the faith; if as common, or as other hiſtorical or dogmatical; then, though I grant that all thoſe whoſe wickedneſſe is ſuch as cannot conſiſt with a real, common, or hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical faith, ought not to be admitted: yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I deny the <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> that all wickedneſſe is ſuch as is inconſiſtent with ſuch a real common faith; that common faith is in its kinde a <hi>true</hi> faith, and that this true common faith is conſiſtent with a wicked heart and life; are two Propoſitions as little doubted by moſt Divines, as much confirmed by ſad experience; and largely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed

            <p>Others may have leave to think that ſuch ſcandalous perſons ought not to be admitted into the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>ſcandal</hi> that would come to <hi>Religion</hi> thereby; and becauſe that in this ſenſe ſcandal is contrary to the profeſſion of the faith; the Church thus drawing a blot and diſparagement upon her ſelfe, as if ſhe was ready to open her boſome to any vile, unclean, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed perſons; and truely, I humbly conceive there is very much in this; for if the Church ought to have a care that thoſe already within, cauſe not the <hi>wayes of God to be evil ſpoken of,</hi> why ought ſhe not to have the like care touching thoſe, ſhe is about to let in? or why ſhould thoſe be admitted into the <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> that now appear to be ſuch as are preſently to be caſt out of <hi>communion?</hi> but I preſume this is not all. For,</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p>7. But with your favour, I muſt now needs note, that all that hath been ſaid, hath not punctually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed our own caſe, our common concernment in <hi>England,</hi> who generally come into the Church in our <hi>Infancy,</hi> and are not admitted thereinto upon our <hi>perſonal</hi> profeſſion at yeares of diſcretion, as <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> are to be; and of which moſt of our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies about the way of admiſſion, now are. For my part, I humbly conceive there are but <hi>two</hi> maine queſtions about <hi>Church-memberſhip</hi> that need much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us. 1. Whether the Infants of Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are borne in the Church, and to be baptized? 2. What is that which <hi>unchurcheth</hi> them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards? It cannot but be heartily wiſh'd, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heat that is or may be ſpent about the conditions of admitting Heathens into the Church, might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved till a practical occaſion requires it, <hi>viz.</hi> till ſuch a Heathen ſhall ſue for baptiſme, whoſe profeſſion or right is truely diſputable. I muſt freely profeſſe, I cannot like that way of reaſoning <hi>[The parent, if he</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:118938:9"/> 
               <hi>were not baptized ſhould not be baptized himſelf, therefore his childe ſhould not be baptized;</hi>] for in all caſes that will keep out, that cannot caſt out; whether Civil, Military, or Eccleſiaſtical. <hi>Poſitive</hi> conſent is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon admiſſion, but a negative, (a non-rejecting the Goſpel) is ſufficient to retaine in the Church; diſtraction of one that was borne in the Church will not caſt him out; yet who would admit a diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Heathen, while ſuch, a perſon known to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate would hardly be received while ſuch; yet <hi>known unregeneracy</hi> is not ſufficient to caſt a man out; <note place="margin">As <hi>Mr. Hooker</hi> before.</note> a ſcandalous perſon may be a Church-member, and is ſo doubtleſſe, till he be excommunicate, and while ſo, he is in the Covenant within, and his child is born in the Church, and hath right to baptiſme; but I ſhall crave leave to ſignifie my mind a little more clearly herein by a few ſteps further.</p>
            <p>8. To draw a little neerer to our ſelves and our own common caſe, I therefore adde, that children borne of Church members, and baptized in infancy, are borne and baptized Church-members; and though our caſe require it not, yet, I doubt not to ſay, that the childes right in the Church and Baptiſme, doth not neceſſarily depend upon a vocal profeſſion (on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) of its parents, who yet abide in the faith, and ſtate of profeſſion (as is hereafter largely diſcuſs'd;) for <hi>in Infants, their being borne in the Church, is inſtead of an outward profeſſion,</hi> as Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth. <note place="margin">His ſum of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion about Baptiſme.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, I verily beleeve the childes actual poſſeſſion of Baptiſme (not of the Church, or Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) depends with the higheſt conveniency upon the parents claiming it, and expreſſe owning the faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he deſires his childe may be baptized, and
<pb facs="tcp:118938:10"/> his publick undertaking to bring it it up in the fear of the Lord according to that, now, moſt general and laudable cuſtome of the Churches of Chriſt amongſt us; which uſage carrieth in my opinion, as cleare a tendency to Reformation and order, as any one practice not expreſſe in Scripture now exerciſed; and truely ſuch as ſeemes to me a great deal liklier to prevail with our people to a publick owning their obligations to God, then any other courſe whereupon we haply fix greater expectations; as (to my obſervation) leſſe obnoxious to the jealouſies and murmurs of a diſturbed diſtracted and diſcontented generation.</p>
            <p>9. Againe, thoſe that were borne in the Church and baptized in their infancy continue in their right and poſſeſſion of Church-memberſhip (as well as thoſe admitted upon perſonal profeſſion at the adult eſtate) until they are juſtly deveſted thereof by themſelves or the Church as before; or (in Maſter <hi>Cottens</hi> plaine and pertinent words the ſuffrage of <hi>N.

            <pb facs="tcp:118938:10"/>
            <p> Conſequently the children of theſe ought alſo to be reckoned members of the Church, and to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, to <hi>ſucceed</hi> in their parents profeſſion, who live and die in a <hi>ſtate</hi> of profeſſion from one generation to another, without exacting any poſitive proofes or evidence of converſion, or ſaving grace in the parents; for they ſtand in poſſeſſion, and 'tis not juſt for any to queſtion their Title, much leſſe to <hi>void</hi> it, without a poſitive diſproving of it; which can by no way be done without the cenſure of the Church upon evidence of obſtinacy in known ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal; which I confirme and conclude with thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent words of worthy Maſter <hi>Baxter.</hi> 
               <q>Thoſe <note place="margin">Diſp. <hi>p.</hi> 34: 34.</note> therefore that will any mans childe kept back from Baptiſme for their parents unholineſſe, or perſons kept from the Supper, muſt not expect that men bring proof to them of their holineſſe, beyond their profeſſion of it, but muſt deale by them as by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notorious offenders, even admoniſh them of their unholy miſcarriages; and he may not be ſo heavily puniſh'd before he be judged or heard.</q>

Thus we are at length arrived at our very caſe (which I deſire may be ſeriouſly conſidered;) who after our fathers, and our fathers fathers; time out of minde, did generally come into the Church, when we came into the world, being borne of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian parents, and ſuch as lived and died in a ſtate of profeſſion, and do continue the <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of the ſame unto this day, without rejecting the faith or the Church into which we were baptized, or yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rejected or cenſured by the Church for obſtinate continuing in any know ſcandal.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118938:11"/>
            <p> Wherefore give me leave <hi>(my Worthy brethren)</hi> to intimate againe, that if any queſtion yet remaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our memberſhip; 'tis not to be reſolved by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating what <hi>qualifications</hi> we ought to require in adult perſons who deſire <hi>admiſſion</hi> or baptiſme, a caſe that hardly happens once in an age; but what it is that nulls the memberſhip of perſons at age, that were borne Chriſtians, and baptized in their infancy; as we generally were in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>center</hi> where all the <hi>lines</hi> drawn like ſwords about moſt of our controverſies muſt point at laſt; a ſound and effectual diſcuſſion of this would doubtleſſe be a happy means of charming the great noiſe amongſt us; according to the determination of this, moſt of our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and practices would eaſily be enforced one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; thought, if without offence, I may ſo complain, this is the thing that is leaſt thought on.</p>
            <p>I have venture in the Treatiſe upon one great and moſt ſpecial queſtion under this: whither, I conceive, we muſt needs be driven upon the debating of the means of unchurching, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the want of ſaving grace be inconſiſtent with viſible Church-memberſhip, and have afterwards, though more briefly conſidered, the general queſtion, what doth not, and what doth <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church</hi> more diſtinctly; as alſo what doth <hi>conſtitute</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> viſible Church-memberſhip. Many other things are likewiſe occaſionally diſcuſs'd, ſome more briefly; and ſome more largely, according as I thought them more or leſſe ſerviceable to my maine deſigne; and at laſt, have added a large application of the whole to our <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> and to our adminiſtrations; wherein ſome haply may judge me too large, and others too ſtrict meaſuring me (as moſt men are wont to do the books they read) by the model and idea of things that prepoſſeſſeth them;
<pb facs="tcp:118938:11"/> though (Reverend Sirs) I cannot but hope better of you, and do hereby cheerfully, (yet in true humility) firſt caſt my ſelf upon your <hi>candour,</hi> and then upon your cenſure and due admonition in any thing you ſhall find amiſſe.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, truely this is a comfort to me, that though ſome, whoſe principles ſeem ſtricteſt, may ſuſpect that mine may favour wickedneſſe, or not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the reformation of the people; I am moſt fully perſwaded, that there is no other lawful or poſſible way of a ſound reformation, of ſhaming ſinne, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging holineſſe, but that which leads from theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which I defend. I ſhould humbly beſeech ſome abler pen to make trial (if there be any doubt at all of it) whether, keeping to this maine principle <hi>[the truth of our Churches]</hi> he can poſſibly go in any other courſe, or further in the ſame courſe towards their ends, then I have done; the truth is I rather feare the exceptions of thoſe who judge me too ſtrict, then of thoſe that cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me too large.</p>
            <p>Onely one thing more I moſt earneſtly begge, not for my own, but for Sions ſake, I earneſtly begge, though we cannot be in ever thing of one minde, yet let us have but one heart, and walk together in one way, untill we muſt needs part, reſting upon the promiſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
            <p>But <hi>(O my dear brethren)</hi> wherein ſo ver we muſt differ, what urging, crying, reaſon is there that we ſhould unite as one man, to maintain our <hi>Churches in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that great <hi>dipoſitum</hi> put into our hands by our <hi>ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,</hi> our very Birth-right, and the greateſt inheritance
<pb facs="tcp:118938:12"/> we can poſſibly leave our poſterity after us! what heed is requiſite to keep out all diſputes as well as principles, that may but ſeeme to queſtion them? how are they ſtruck at on every ſide, how undermined? how doth diviſion and Hereſie dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moulder them? what a deluge of <hi>Popery</hi> is ready to overwhelme them?</p>

                  <p>2. Viſibility is alſo ſometimes taken for that <hi>affection</hi> of a thing <note place="margin">2. What it is.</note> whereby the thing ſeemeth to be what indeed it is, and ſhewes it ſelf <hi>ad extra</hi> to be ſuch. Now here <hi>viſible</hi> is nothing elſe but that

                  <p>According to their <hi>Integral ſtate, aggregative</hi> bodies, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed into their <hi>parts</hi> qua <hi>integral,</hi> and according to the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of them; which are ſometimes <hi>ſimilar,</hi> ſometimes <hi>diſſimilar.</hi>

                  <p>That the Church of Chriſt is moſt properly viſible, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:118938:25"/> 2. Now the Church is confeſſed to be an <hi>Aggregative</hi> body, and yet the parts or members, are doubtleſſe viſible, in moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpeaking, whether we conſider them as Men, or as men Called.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The members of the Church are <hi>Men;</hi> and who can doubt but that men are <hi>viſible</hi> in the higheſt propriety of ſpeech, that runnes not againſt his own ſenſe? yea, ſhould we yeeld that <hi>ſaving</hi> grace alone doth unite men to the Church, yet ſeeing 'tis not the <hi>grace</hi> (which is inviſible) that is the member, but the <hi>man</hi> (who is inviſible) the <hi>members</hi> of the Church are viſible ſtill.

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>Therefore if that part of the Church which in one regard bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the name of inviſible, be as properly viſible, as the other which is <hi>onely</hi> viſible, who can doubt but that the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is moſt properly viſible.

                     <hi>ſort cannot be inviſible; neither did any of our men teach, that it is or may be.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The whole Church doth moſt properly deſerve the name [Church]; for though both the viſible and the inviſible Church ſhould be truely and properly a Church of Chriſt, yet if in a ſtrict conſideration, one of theſe is but a part, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the whole, containeth that part, that which containeth the other as its part muſt needs be the whole, and beſt deſerve the name of the whole.</p>
                  <p>Now the inviſible Church hath beene found to be the part of the viſible, and the viſible to be the whole containing that part, ſeeing all that ſavingly beleeve do equally ſhare in the Churches profeſſion and viſibility with the externally called; Yea, and they, that is, the <hi>ſincere beleevers,</hi> as Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> aſſerts, are <note place="margin">

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>But now the <hi>viſible</hi> Church is the Scripture-Church, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares from the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Scripture about the Church, the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118938:26"/> 
                     <hi>examples,</hi> the <hi>parts,</hi> the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and number of Scripture-Churches.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Scripture about the Church, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuch as agreeth <hi>onely</hi> with the Church-viſible, <hi>viz.</hi> as made up of <hi>tares</hi> and <hi>wheat,</hi> good and bad, Elect and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Yea, the very word [Church] in Scripture as ſome affirme, is not more then once taken for the Church-inviſible, which is <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23. though that very place is by ſome Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines underſtood of the Church-viſible alſo, for it was already <hi>come into,</hi> by perſons then alive <hi>[ye are come;]</hi> therefore the Church on <hi>earth,</hi> and it was a Church that had <hi>Ordinances</hi> in it, <hi>v.</hi> 25. therefore the <hi>viſible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if it ſhould be granted, as Maſter <hi>Blake</hi> obſerves, that in this place and in two or three more, the Scripture meaneth the Church inviſible, which is as much as can be pretended unto,—yet doubtleſſe that which is the ordinary language of the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> which he uſeth moſt often, and almoſt always, is that which is moſt proper.</p>
                  <p>2. It alſo appears from the <hi>examples</hi> of Scripture-Churches, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>De quâ ſolâ ecclefiâ prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptivâ, &amp;c.</hi> Dav. Detern. p. 218. <hi>ex ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latenſi.</hi>
                     </note> for have not even all theſe a <hi>mixture</hi> of corrupt and wicked mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? and is ſuch a mixture compatible with the Church <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible?</hi> or what Churches can ſuch be, but viſible? therefore ſaith <hi>Davenant, all ſuch Scriptures, and aſſertions of the fathers as ſpeak of this mixture of good and bad in the Church, are to be underſtood of the preſumptive or viſible Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. It further appeares by the <hi>parts</hi> of the Scripture-Church, which are generally ſuch as are onely to be found in the viſile Church, that the Scripture-Church is the viſible Church. The parts of the Scripture-Church are generally Prieſt and people, Paſtors and flock, the Rulers and the ruled, the Catechiſers and the catechized, and the like, as both the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi> Teſtament abundantly teſtifie. Now in the Church inviſible there are no ſuch parts, no ſuch relations, no ſuch officers, but all are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but Chriſt the head; therefore the Scripture-Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe parts and officers, as <hi>ſuch</hi> are, <hi>viz.</hi> Prieſts, Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Biſhops, Paſtors, Elders, Deacons, Rulers, Cetechizers, &amp;c. muſt needs be the viſible Church.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:118938:26"/>
                  <p> Fourthly, that the Scripture-churche is the viſible Church, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears moreover by the <hi>diſpenſation of Ordinances</hi> fixed therein, which is proper and peculiar to the viſible Church, in all the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Churches we finde a diſpenſation of the Word, Sacraments, diſcipline; the diſpenſation whereof is in the hands of men; who are onely capable of dealing with the Church as viſible; yea, the diſpenſation it ſelf is viſible; and all will readily grant that theſe Ordinances are all of them peculiar to the viſible Church; the attendance of the Church upon them being the moſt eminent and remarkable meanes of rendring the Church her ſelf to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this yet farther appears from the <hi>number</hi> of the Scripture-churches, they are <hi>many,</hi> the Church at <hi>Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Epheſus, Coloſſe, Philippi, Theſſalonica, Pergamus, Thyatira, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas the <hi>inviſible</hi> Church is alſo <hi>indiviſible,</hi> 'tis but one, and not to be divided into any more; therefore the Scripture-church which is thus actually divided muſt needs be the viſible Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. My laſt Argument is taken from the <hi>Name</hi> [Church], and may be this. The viſible Church in its <hi>nature</hi> doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly anſwer to the <hi>name</hi> [Church], therefore it is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Church; for that thing which doth in its <hi>nature</hi> moſt properly anſwer to ſuch a <hi>name,</hi> muſt needs be the <hi>thing</hi> moſt properly which that <hi>name</hi> doth ſignifie.</p>
                  <p>Now the nature of the viſible Church may be obſerved to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the name, Church, in a moſt proper ſignification, both in Engliſh, Latine, Greek, and Hebrew.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In Engliſh, the word [Church] doth in a true and direct propriety of ſpeech ſignifie nothing but that which is the <hi>Lords;</hi> and may be conceived to imply the Lords <hi>people,</hi> or the Lords <hi>houſe;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

Now if the name [Church] intend the <hi>people</hi> of the Lord, meeting together in one <hi>place,</hi> to attend on the worſhip of God, we need not much trouble our ſelves for its proper application, to the <hi>viſible</hi> Church.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, the Church in <hi>Greek</hi> is [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] which moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly imports a people <hi>called out of the world,</hi> (as anon, more largely.) Indeed, the <hi>term from,</hi> or out of which, the Church is called, is not expreſſed in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, yet all agree, that it is as neceſſarily implied in it.</p>
                  <p>Now this ſenſe of the word, <hi>Church,</hi> moſt properly and exactly intendeth the Church-viſible, this being moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently and properly <hi>called out of the world;</hi> as eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>world,</hi> here, muſt be underſtood to be either the world of the <hi>ungodly,</hi> or the world of <hi>infidels;</hi> but it cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the world of the ungodly, becauſe there is ſtill a mixture of the Church and the world in this ſenſe (according to that of our Saviour, <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldſt take them out of the world;)</hi> then if the world out of which the Church is called be the world of <hi>Infidels, viz.</hi> of ſuch as live without the pale of the <hi>Chriſtian profeſſion,</hi> I think it will be eaſily granted, firſt, that ſuch as own the ſaid Chriſtian profeſſion are moſt properly oppoſed to, and called out of the <hi>world</hi> in this ſenſe; and ſecondly, that ſuch are moſt properly the viſible Church.</p>

               <p>WE now proceed to the <hi>predicate</hi> in queſtion, or that which is queſtioned of this ſubject, the viſible Church; contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe words of the queſtion [truely a Church of Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to ſaving grace.]</p>
               <p>Wherein we have before obſerved; Firſt, that which is more directly queſtioned, in theſe words [truely a Church of Chriſt.] Secondly, the condition or limitation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the words annex'd [without reſpect to ſaving grace.]</p>
               <p>To begin with the firſt, I humbly conceive that a good and cleare underſtanding of this terme <hi>[truely],</hi> or how the Church may be ſaid to be <hi>truely</hi> ſo, may have a ſtrong ſubſerviency to a happy deciſion of the main controverſie; wherefore, I ſhall take the liberty to enlarge my <hi>ſenſe</hi> and notion thereof, to as much plaineſſe as I am able.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Truth</hi> as predicable of the viſible Church, is ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by <hi>vera,</hi> and ſometimes by <hi>verè.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>vera eccleſia</hi> is uſually meant the Church, not onely endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Eccleſia vera.</note> with the truth of <hi>being,</hi> but endowed alſo with the truth of <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> or the goodneſſe of <hi>well-being,</hi> and under ſome excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>doctrine</hi> or <hi>manners,</hi> or both.</p>
               <p>By verè eccleſia is uſually intended the being of the Church <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verè.</hi>
                  </note> alone, and not the quality, unleſſe ſo farre it intend the evil qualities of any Church, as to ſecure its being againſt them.</p>
               <p>Accordingly Divines uſe to ſay, that ſuch a Church as is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corrupt, and yet retaineth the eſſence or being of a Church of Chriſt, is, <hi>verè,</hi> or truely a Church of Chriſt, but not <hi>vera ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia,</hi> or a true Church, that is a pure or an holy Church: as an honeſt man is ſaid to be <hi>verus homo,</hi> a true man, and a <hi>thief</hi> who is not properly ſaid to be a true man, is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe <hi>verè homo,</hi> and as truely a man as any other; <hi>verè</hi> ſerving to expreſſe truth as natural, and <hi>vera,</hi> as moral.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:118938:28"/>
               <p> Yet, with leave, though this diſtinction may ſerve to explain <note place="margin">The diſtinction excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</note> our meanings, I adde, that 'tis well-known to all that are ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that both theſe termes <hi>[vera</hi> and <hi>verè]</hi> may be lawfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Church, or any thing, while the <hi>phyſical</hi> being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is not wholly periſh'd, though the defects in <hi>morals</hi> be never ſo notorious; if we ſpeak of the ſubject under that notion, and of truth as attributed thereunto in its phyſical acceptation. A thief is doubtleſſe a true man, as well as truely a man; if we ſpeak of a thief <hi>quatenus homo,</hi> as a man, and not as a good or bad man, morally true or falſe. Thus alſo the Church may be ſaid to be as well a true, as truely a Church of Chriſt, while its eſſentials re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in it, and it hath not yet loſt its natural being, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo corrupt in moral concernments, or never ſo much to be cenſured or condemned in any ſuch reſpects; for if the Church hath its <hi>Ens,</hi> it muſt be allowed its <hi>verum</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>3. But it appeareth that the queſtion carrieth the weaker terme <hi>(viz.</hi> truely,) as that which is likelieſt to be yeelded unto, by ſuch as are likelieſt to diſſent upon the whole; whereby it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily <note place="margin">The terme ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the queſtion.</note> appeareth to the Reader what is enquired after in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, namely, not whether the viſible Church may be conſidered to be a <hi>pure</hi> or a perfect Church, or a true Church in a moral ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity? but whether it may be conſidered to be truely a Church, that is to have all the eſſentials of a viſible Church, or its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural being without reſpect to ſaving grace? or whether the bei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the viſible Church, have a neceſſary dependance upon ſaving qualifications?</p>
               <p>4. It may be alſo heeded, that though the queſtion run [whether it may be ſo conſidered] (the reaſon whereof may appeare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) yet the queſtion is not whether the truth of the Church conſiſt only in conſideration; for the weight of our queſtion reſteth upon the truth of the Churches being <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> and not in our <hi>minds</hi> or conception, onely this nature and truth of the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our mindes cannot be ſo, <hi>quoad nos,</hi> without an act of our minde, <hi>viz.</hi> conſideration; but the queſtion properly is <hi>de veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, eccleſiae viſibilis</hi> (as the <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> ſpeak) <hi>in eſſendo;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118938:28"/> a real thing thing; ſeeing <hi>competere alicui atra mentis operationem,</hi> is the known definition of <hi>Reale eſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, this common expreſſion [truely a Church] is deſired to be kept unto, to keep out thoſe troubleſome and diſputable termes, of <hi>eccleſia aequivoca,</hi> and <hi>eccleſia preſumptiva,</hi> which are wont to perplex this controverſie; to both of which this <hi>verè eccleſia,</hi> or the truth of the Churches being in it ſelf ſtands in as <hi>evident</hi> as <hi>direct</hi> oppoſition; for the <hi>aequivocal</hi> Church, in the ſenſe of moſt of thoſe that diſſent from me, hath no truth of being at all; and the <hi>preſumed</hi> Church dependeth upon the charity of the mind of thoſe that conſider it, and hath not that being that is to be certainly knowne and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by us, as it is here in queſtion; but more plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The evaſion of <hi>eccleſia preſumptiva</hi> is thus anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated, whether it import the viſible or inviſible Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If by this <hi>preſumed</hi> Church be meant the <hi>viſible,</hi> which in favour and charity we preſume to be a Church (as <hi>Spalaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> and after him <hi>Davenant</hi> ſeemeth to ſome to imply) though we know not who are true members thereof, becauſe we know not who among them have ſaving grace; then, who ſeeth not, that this <hi>preſumption</hi> begs the queſtion; it being evidently built upon that ſuppoſition, which is mainly in controverſie, <hi>viz.</hi> that one cannot be a true member of the viſible Church without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace; this acceptation of the Church taketh up that <hi>reſpect to ſaving grace</hi> which is queſtioned, and therefore can claime no place in the controverſie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But if by this <hi>preſumed</hi> Church be meant the inviſible Church, or the Church of the ſaved, which ſeems more proper, ſeeing we can onely preſume and conjecture, (as <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Inſibili credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus eſſe electos aliquos, etiamſi qui illi ſint non novimus ſcientia perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta, ſed conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturali dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxat.</hi> Col. Theo. p. 4. diſp. 13. Theſ. 7,</note> 
                  <hi>Maccovius</hi> ſaith) who are the true members thereof. Yet thus it concerneth not us at all, who are now debating a queſtion about the viſible, and not the inviſible Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In like manner the term <hi>aequivocum</hi> is ſtruck out of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie; for if the queſtion be, as ours is, whether the Church be <hi>truely</hi> ſo without reſpect to ſaving grace? and the anſwer be this, that ſuch are onely members of the Church <hi>ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocè,</hi> that have no ſaving grace, the thing in queſtion is evidently
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118938:29"/> begg'd, if <hi>aequivecè</hi> be oppoſed to <hi>truly,</hi> as uſually herein it is.</p>
               <p>6. But there being ſo much noiſe at preſent about the termes <hi>univocum aequivocum &amp; analogum</hi> about this thing, I think my Reader will look for ſome longer account of my minde therein, which though I am loath to do, yet I humbly offer in a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we ſhall be able to prove that the truth of the viſible Church doth not neceſſarily ſuppoſe ſaving grace, and that ſuch as have no ſaving grace may <hi>truely</hi> be ſaid to be of the Church: I humbly conceive we need not trouble our ſelves at all, whether they be ſo <hi>univocè, equivocè</hi> or <hi>analogicè.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet, although I preſume it might ſafely be aſſerted, that wicked men may be members of the viſible Church <hi>univocally,</hi> I ſhould for peace and quiet ſake be very well ſatisfied with this, that they are moſt properly ſo <hi>per analogiam;</hi> wherein, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive we may almoſt meet with both thoſe Reverend and eminent men, Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> as appears under both their hands in print. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. However, if I may make my own choice, I had rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the memberſhip of <hi>hypocrites</hi> unto that branch of <hi>Analogy</hi> which <hi>Bueerwood</hi> calls, <hi>Dignitatis ſolius;</hi> which truely, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, (if I may be plaine,) ſhould fit the notion of moſt men that trouble themſelves in the point, and are loath to be <hi>Browniſts.</hi>

The <hi>analogy of dignity</hi> onely, ſaith he, is, when one member of it, is more worthy then the other: and inſtances, thus <hi>homo,</hi> and <hi>Brutum.</hi> are Analogous of the name <hi>Animal;</hi> though (to ſatisfie us how unworthy this is of an eager diſpute with <hi>Divines,</hi> when we ſee ſuch a difference among <hi>Logicians</hi> themſelves) <hi>Stierius,</hi> and other Logicians bring us, the very ſame inſtance of <hi>univoca;</hi> but if we keep our ſelves to this branch of analogy, on which we have pitch'd, it may help me to explain my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>1. Both man and beaſt are <hi>animal;</hi> ſo both the hypocrite, and the Elect; regenerate, are Church-members. 2.

               <p>HAving hitherto laboured in the Explication of the <hi>ſubject</hi> of the queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> and of its <hi>attribute directly</hi> in queſtion, <hi>viz. truely a Church of Chriſt;</hi> we proceed to the <hi>condition</hi> or limitation thereof, contained in the words an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd, <hi>without reſpect to ſaving grace;</hi> which for the ſake of diſpatch, we ſhall look upon together with the Copula, which ſerveth to joyne the <hi>ſubject</hi> and the <hi>attribute</hi> in the queſtion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, containe in theſe words [may be conſidered to be;] which that we may the eaſier receive our explication of, we ſhall ſent the queſtion at full once more before us, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether the viſible Church <hi>may be conſidered to be</hi> truely a Church of Chriſt <hi>without reſpect to ſaving grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where, that we may further obſerve the <hi>reaſon,</hi> as well as the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the termes, I humbly beg my readers <hi>patience</hi> yet carefully to heed,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:118938:30"/> 1. That it is not queſtioned, whether <hi>the viſible Church</hi> may be <hi>without</hi> reſpect <hi>to ſaving grace;</hi> but whether it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, &amp;c. that would have ſounded very improperly.</p>
               <p>For <hi>reſpect</hi> doth not flow a <hi>principio eſſendi,</hi> but a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio cognoſcendi; and naturally anſwers onely thereunto: <hi>Reſpect</hi> is but a looking upon, or unto, which requireth an <hi>eye,</hi> either <hi>real, viz.</hi> bodily, if the diſcourſe be of <hi>ſenſible</hi> objects; or <hi>metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, viz.</hi> of the <hi>minde;</hi> if the diſcourſe be of intellectual or <hi>rational</hi> objects, as this that is before us here; <hi>viz. ſaving grace,</hi> is.</p>
               <p>Here we have a <hi>rational object, viz,</hi> ſaving grace, and a rational <hi>ſight,</hi> or a looking upon or unto it, <hi>viz.</hi> in the word <hi>reſpect;</hi> and therein, therein is plainly rational <hi>eye</hi> and act ſuppoſed as fit to be expreſſed, which here is done by this terme in the queſtion; <hi>Conſideration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had the queſtion been of the truth of the viſible Church <hi>in general,</hi> without reſpect; it might have been thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>viz. whether the viſible be truely a Church,</hi> and no more.</p>
               <p>Or had the queſtion been onely and ſimply of <hi>the Churches dependency upon ſaving grace,</hi> and not of our reſpect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; it might have beene expreſſed thus. <hi>Whether the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church be truely a Church without ſaving grace,</hi> and no more.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing, as we ſhall preſently finde, that there is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſity of the latter words, <hi>[without reſpect</hi> to ſaving grace,] there is alſo a manifeſt neceſſity of ſuch a kind of <hi>copula,</hi> as here we have <hi>[viz. may be conſidered]</hi> or conceived, or thought, or imagined to be, or the like; and the meaning thereof is briefly but thus.</p>
               <p>Whether we may take a <hi>true apprehenſion,</hi> conception, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> in the being or nature thereof, <hi>without an eye</hi> or reſpect unto <hi>ſaving grace;</hi> or whether we muſt neceſſarily take ſaving grace into our thoughts, to a right and true underſtanding of the viſible Church to be truely a Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the queſtion is not <hi>whether the viſible Church may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered to be truely a Church of Chriſt</hi> without <hi>ſaving grace;</hi> but without reſpect to ſaving grace.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:118938:30"/>
               <p> For if the Church neither ever were, nor yet is, nor ever ſhall be, or exiſt, without this (i. e.) true ſaving grace; it will not help, or profit us much to finde, whether it be ſo in our Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, or not; yet if it ſhall be proved that ſaving grace is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quarto modo.</hi>
                  </note> neither of the <hi>eſſence</hi> or <hi>property</hi> of the Church, it will thence, eaſily follow, that there is no contradiction in <hi>conſidering</hi> a Church <hi>to be truely</hi> ſuch without it; yea, I ſuppoſe, it will further follow, that <hi>this viſible Church,</hi> ſo conſidered without ſaving grace, hath not its being onely in reaſon or conſideration, but hath ſome foundation of being <hi>in re,</hi> and is at leaſt <hi>ens rationis ratiocinatae,</hi> and ſo conſidered <hi>conceptu objectivo,</hi> as the Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks ſpeak. Yea, I know not but that happily it may claim one ſtep further, and be termed <hi>ens reale,</hi> if we mean <hi>ens real potentiâ, non actu;</hi> but,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The queſtion, laſtly, is not <hi>whether the viſible Church</hi> may be <hi>(i. e. actually) without ſaving grace;</hi> but whether it may be conſidered to be truely a Church without reſpect to ſaving grace; that is, whether ſaving grace be either of the <hi>eſſence</hi> or <hi>property</hi> of the Church, or ſo neere unto the nature and being of it, as that it cannot be conceived to be, but reſpect muſt be had to ſaving grace, this is the very ſenſe of the queſtion before us; yet concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this which is denyed to be our queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> the actual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church without ſaving grace, I ſhall <hi>crave</hi> leave to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe my ſelf in a few <hi>particulars,</hi> which I humbly conceive, may have, yet ſome further and direct ſubſerviency to the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my mind, touching the queſtion, with which I ſhall conclude that word.</p>
               <p>I readily grant, that though ſaving grace be not of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or property of the viſible Church, yet <hi>ſaving grace is of the excellency &amp; bene eſſe of it;</hi> but even therefore ſaving grace is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to be neceſſary in our conſideration of the nature and being of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>A ſymmetry of part, ſtrength of body, lively colour, conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of braine, quickneſſe of fancy, ſoundneſſe of minde, retention of memory, and good diſcourſe, all theſe are of the excellency and glory of a man, yet not one of them require a neceſſary place in one conſideration, when we would conceive, of his nature and property, <hi>quatenus homo,</hi> as he is a man; for he may be a man without all theſe, and therefore he may doubtleſſe be conceived
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118938:31"/> a man and truely, without reſpect to any of them; the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hereof to our preſent diſcourſe is eaſily left to my Reader.</p>
               <p>2. I further grant that as it cannot be, but that <hi>many</hi> indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual men among the reſt of the kinde, <hi>will be thus excellently qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,</hi> as before, ſo neither can it ever be, but that many indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual members of the viſible Church, ſhall be endued with ſaving grace, according to that of <hi>

               </p>
               <p>3. Yet I humble offer whether the cauſe of this impoſſibility may not be thought to lie rather in the <hi>will</hi> of God ſo determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and conſequently be a thing extrinſecal to the being of the Church; then in the nature of the Church, or any thing intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal thereunto? and whether the viſible Church might not, for any thing in the nature thereof to the contrary, be truely a Church of Chriſt, though there <hi>ſhould not be one</hi> member in it for a time <hi>ſavingly qualified?</hi> though it be ſtill granted, that for the glory of grace, the Lord hath ſo ordained, that it never ſhall be <hi>actually</hi> ſo.</p>
               <p>Even as (to follow my preſent ſimilitude) it is impoſſible, but there ſhould be <hi>many wiſe</hi> and judicious men in the world: yet this neceſſity lieth not in the nature of man, but rather in the will of God, that hath ſo <hi>ordained</hi> for the <hi>glory</hi> of his own name, and the good of ſociety in the world.</p>
               <p>And if at laſt it iſſue thus, I ſee not but that we may ſafely conclude the viſible Church without ſaving grace; to be in the former ſenſe <hi>Ens reale, id eſt,</hi> potentia; if he define <hi>ens reale</hi> well, that ſaith it is, <hi>quod habet eſſe ex parte Rei, actu vel potentia;</hi> ſeeing ſuch a Church hath its being, <hi>ex parte rei, potentia;</hi> and the onely reaſon why it hath not the ſame <hi>actualitèr,</hi> is not <hi>ex parte rei, ſed ex parte Dei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Yet once more, I humbly offer, that ſeeing there may be a <hi>Corporation</hi> of men, without one wiſe or learned man amongſt them, why may not there be a particular Church in the world, without one member ſavingly qualified, at leaſt for ſome certaine ſpace of time, &amp;c?</p>

               <p>Neither can thoſe words of God to <hi>Paul, for I have much people in this City,</hi> inforce any ſuch thing, though we grant that much people to be the Elect; for</p>

               <p>2.

                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed, this which I terme <hi>effectual calling</hi> is twofold; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effectual, either onely in <hi>common;</hi> or alſo in <hi>ſaving</hi> effects. The firſt, to wit, that <hi>calling,</hi> which onely reacheth unto <hi>common</hi> ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, is that by which perſons are called out of the world, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce</hi> all <hi>falſe</hi> Gods, and to <hi>profeſſe</hi> the <hi>true</hi> God, according to the <hi>true Religion,</hi> and thus to become truely members of the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> Church, and of the number of the <hi>many called</hi> in the Text; and therefore, I humbly deſire, that two things may be here no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 1. That though ſome pleaſe to terme this <hi>kinde of call par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialis,</hi> it muſt onely be underſtood with reſpeact to that other <hi>ſaving work,</hi> which belongs to the <hi>next</hi> branch of the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not at all with reſpect to the work <hi>ſpecified,</hi> or the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to be <hi>truely</hi> members of the <hi>viſible</hi> Church; which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe is <hi>perfectly</hi> and totally done by the <hi>true</hi> and genuine <hi>efficacy</hi> of this which we terme a <hi>common call.</hi> Secondly, let it be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noted, therefore, that when we ſay this common call is effectual to <hi>common</hi> effects, we mean onely ſuch <hi>effects,</hi> as are <hi>common</hi> to the <hi>Elect</hi> and <hi>Reprobate,</hi> but not common to the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>world,</hi> but <hi>ſpecial</hi> and peculiar to the <hi>Church</hi> alone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>more are called then</hi> are <hi>elected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond <hi>ſort</hi> of <hi>effectual</hi> calling, to wit, that which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>ſaving</hi> effects; is indeed, though not, more <hi>truely effectually,</hi> yet more <hi>gradually,</hi> and further, if not <hi>ſpecifically</hi> more, effectual then the former; for it bringeth men not an <hi>eccleſiaſtical,</hi> but alſo to a <hi>myſtical</hi> and ſaving union with Jeſus Chriſt, and by that which is oppoſed to the <hi>common</hi> faith, which is ſaid to be wrought by the former <hi>common call,</hi> and is uſually called <hi>juſtifying</hi> or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith; which is called by thoſe which terme the call <hi>partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, vocatio totalis,</hi> and is, as I conceive, plainly implied in the choſen, in the text fore-cited; <hi>few are choſen,</hi> i. e. <hi>few are called</hi> (as <hi>Ameſius</hi> expreſſeth it) <hi>according to election.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The diſtribution being thus laid, two things are briefly to be done in order to a <hi>fit application</hi> thereof, and then I have ended this firſt Argument.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:118938:36"/> 1. To <hi>Apologize</hi> for this (which to ſome may ſeeme a new) ſenſe of the common diſtinction of calling into effectual and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To evince this <hi>common</hi> call to be <hi>truely</hi> a call.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe, the diſtribution forelaid, ſeeming ſo <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> to my ſelf, and ſo <hi>adequate</hi> to the <hi>meaning,</hi> if not to the very <hi>termes</hi> of <hi>moſt</hi> Divines, I hope little need be ſaid yet.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I muſt confeſſe it is ſomewhat <hi>rare</hi> for Divines, to terme the <hi>common</hi> calling <hi>effectual</hi> calling; yet, I preſume, it is as ſeldome termed <hi>ineffectual. Trelcatius</hi> gives the term <hi>efficax</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto the ſaving call; yet he doth not term the common call (op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by himſelf in the very ſame place unto the ſaving, and as he ſtileth it effectual call) <hi>in efficax.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yea, though <hi>Trelcatius</hi> doth not terme this common call <hi>efficax,</hi> he doth evidently imply that it may be lawfully termed ſo; he tells us that <hi>externa vocatio</hi> is that <hi>quam mediatè Deus efficit;</hi> Now if this common or external call be that which doth <hi>efficere,</hi> it may doubtleſſe be properly ſaid to be effectual; yea, more <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Inſtit. p.</hi> 114.</note> plainly in another place, he teacheth, that <hi>efficacitas vocationis eſt duplex, una ſalutaris, electorum propria:</hi> Altera non ſalutaris, <hi>ſed praevia ſecundum ordinem communem, &amp; ad vocatos commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niter ſpectans;</hi> ſo that there is an efficacy in the common call which is not ſaving, and therefore this common call is <hi>efficax.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. However a Learned Authour of our own, <hi>viz.</hi> Reverend Maſter <hi>Baxter</hi> hath authorized it for me; it was noted before <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apol. p.</hi> 88.</note> that he allowed us the former branch of the diſtinction, <hi>viz.</hi> voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ffectual, as common to Pagans; and again in <hi>terminis,</hi> he affords the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> vocation which is effectual only to bring men to an outward profeſſion, which he alſo ſaith is larger then Election.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, I acknowledge, 'tis the ſenſe of the diſtinction, and not the terms I conteſt for; and if I may be granted that, let theſe be cenſured as my reader pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>2. Now that this external or more properly common call, is truely a call; and that thoſe that are called therewith are truely called, though not ſavingly appeareth thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) This was the called which our Saviour affirmeth the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118938:37"/> many were called withal. For, firſt, theſe were called not with the calling common to Heathens onely, nor with that calling which is proper to the Elect, therefore they were called according to that only branch remaining, <hi>viz.</hi> the common effectual call, which brought them into the viſible Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Call cannot be meant of the uneffectual call common to Heathens, theſe words of Chriſt <hi>[many are called]</hi> are the cloſe of two Parables, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 16. and 22. 14. the one of labourers called to the vine-yard, the other of gueſts called to the feaſt; and in both, applyed to them that anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the call; that came and laboured in the vine-yard; that came with other bidden ones to the feaſt, and not to thoſe that refus'd.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither yet can it be meant of the ſaving effectual Call, for we ſee it is applied by Chriſt, unto more then are capable of ſaving vocation, more then are Elected, as before was noted; therefore it muſt needs be meant of that which is termed an effectual call oppoſed to that which is ineffectual; and a common call, oppoſed to that which is more then common, <hi>viz.</hi> ſaving.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) This muſt needs be truely a call, becauſe it is the ſame call which the Elect partake of. I grant rhe Elect partake of an higher call, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſaving, which the reprobate never enjoy; yet the Elect have the ſame call which the reprobate have; as ſeemes clearly to be collected from the words before us; for the few choſen are apparently included in the many called; they were all called, and but few of them choſen.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) This common Call is a true effect, therefore alſo truely a call: yea, a divine effect, a work of God himſelf, and that he is <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vocatio commu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nis eſt actio Dei</hi> Inſtit. p. 109</note> pleaſed to <hi>efficere,</hi> as <hi>Trelcatius</hi> ſpeaks, who further and more expreſſely termes it Gods action, therefore doubtleſſe not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, but true in its kind.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This common call is alſo a true cauſe, and therefore it muſt needs prove it ſelf to have a true being, to be truely a call in its kinde: for <hi>nihil agit quod non eſt.</hi> It is a true cauſe, for it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth true effects: perſons by this common call are truely brought out of the world of infidels, and united to the viſible people and Church of God; to own and profeſſe Jeſus Chriſt, to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wayes and Ordinances of his worſhip, to ſee ſome neceſſity
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118938:37"/> of faith and repentance, and of yeelding obedience to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt, as <hi>Trelcatius</hi> aptly aſſerts, <hi>vocatio communis eſt Actio Dei gratioſa qua homines—ab infidelitate ad fidem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vecat.</hi>

                  <p n="5">(5.) In this common call are both the neceſſary parts of a <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That this <hi>calling out,</hi> which we finde in the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> doth not ſo properly or exactly note the <hi>inward ſtate</hi> from which, as the <hi>outward caetus,</hi> or ſociety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Therefore, the viſible Church may be conſidered to <hi>be truely a Church</hi> of Chriſt, without reſpect to ſaving grace.</p>

               <p> As we may conſider the <hi>cauſes</hi> of any thing, ſo we may conſider the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But we may conſider the <hi>cauſes</hi> of this Church to be <hi>real,</hi> cauſes <hi>without reſpect to ſaving grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>truely</hi> a Church, without reſpect to ſaving grace.</p>
               <p>I think, the major will not be queſtion'd by any; ſeeing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever any thing is <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> it is the ſame, firſt in its <hi>cauſes;</hi>

                  </note> yea, the very <hi>definition</hi> of the <hi>effect</hi> is, that it is but the <hi>reſult,</hi> or that which hath its <hi>very ſelfe</hi> of the <hi>cauſe,</hi> and <hi>depends</hi> by its cauſe; and therefore it is called <hi>effectum,</hi> or a thing done, or ſtanding as it is, by it <hi>cauſe,</hi> and <hi>cauſalum,</hi> that is a thing cauſed, that is ſuch a thing, as is <note place="margin">

                  <hi>no more</hi> a thing, then what it hath from its <hi>cauſe,</hi> or as it is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and <hi>cauſality</hi> or cauſation (which is but the <hi>formal reaſon</hi> of the <hi>cauſe)</hi> is nothing elſe but that <hi>Influx,</hi> or concurrence whereby every cauſe, in its own kinde, doth <hi>actually flow</hi> into the effect.</p>
               <p>The <hi>minor</hi> onely then reſteth upon <hi>proof, viz.

               <p>Here, now, are <hi>two</hi> things to be <hi>joyntly</hi> enquired after. Firſt, what theſe <hi>cauſes</hi> are. Secondly, whether they may be conſidered to be real cauſes of the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, without reſpect to <hi>ſaving</hi> grace;</p>
               <p>Let us firſt then begin to conſider the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, thus; namely, <hi>what it is,</hi> and what kinde of <hi>effects</hi> it worketh, without reſpect to <hi>ſaving</hi> grace.</p>

                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:118938:39"/> in the <hi>adminiſtration</hi> or ordination of it, is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> thus God <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 5 1 Cor. 3. 11 Col. 1. 18.</note> is properly the <hi>authour;</hi> and Chriſt is properly the <hi>head</hi> of the Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>instrumental</hi> cauſe of the Church, eſpecially in its <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 2. 41 2 Pet. 2 23 1 Tim. 2. 15</note> is the <hi>preaching</hi> of the word; for <hi>how can they beleeve in him, of whom they have not heard, and how can they hear without a preacher;</hi> this diſtribution needeth no proof, ſeeing it is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowed.</p>
               <p>2. Let us, now, come to our <hi>task,</hi> and examine whether theſe <hi>efficient</hi> cauſes, may not be conſidered to have a <hi>real</hi> influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, which yet doth not include <hi>ſaving</hi> grace.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>inſtrument,</hi> the preaching of the word, we need not inſiſt particularly thereupon; partly becauſe the <hi>inſtrument</hi> is but <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to its <hi>principal:</hi> efficient in the ſame opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore, if the work of <hi>principal efficient</hi> be <hi>real,</hi> ſo is, doubtleſſe, the <hi>ſame</hi> work relating to the <hi>inſtrument</hi> of it; and partly, becauſe the <hi>influence</hi> of this <hi>inſtrumental</hi> cauſe, the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word, into the <hi>conſtitution</hi> of the viſible Church, is <hi>reſerved</hi> to be largely handled, in anſwer to a great obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt <hi>cur</hi> Churches in <hi>England</hi> at the <hi>latter</hi> end of this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore we have but two things here before us, whether <hi>God</hi> may be conſidered to be <hi>truely</hi> the <hi>Authour;</hi> or Chriſt to be <hi>truely</hi> the <hi>head</hi> of the viſible Church; without reſpect to ſaving grace; and of theſe in <hi>order,</hi> I ſhall humbly ſignifie my opinion, by forming the ſame into <hi>Arguments.</hi>

                  <hi>The</hi> Argument <hi>from</hi> God, <hi>as the</hi> Authour <hi>of the viſible Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If God, in the <hi>conſtitution</hi> of the viſible Church, by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, may be conſidered <hi>really</hi> to <hi>effect</hi> the ſame, without the beſtowing of <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, then he may; without doubt, be conſidered to be the <hi>real Authour</hi> of the viſible Church without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>ſaving</hi> grace.</p>
               <p>But, now God in the <hi>conſtitution</hi> of the Church, by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word may be conſidered, <hi>really</hi> to effect the ſame, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the beſtowing of <hi>ſaving</hi> grace.</p>

               <p>Firſt, that the <hi>calling,</hi> whereby men are brought to leave the <hi>world,</hi> to renounce <hi>Idols,</hi> to embrace the true religion, <hi>Hyſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> to believe the Goſpel, to ſee a neceſſity of depending on Chriſt, <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to ſalvation, are no real works, but this would be againſt common <hi>ſenſe;</hi> for we ſee the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with our eyes.</p>
               <p>Or ſecondly, that theſe <hi>common</hi> works are alſo <hi>ſaving</hi> works; but this would be againſt <hi>experience;</hi> which ſadly tells us, that men may go <hi>ſo farre,</hi> and yet <hi>no further</hi> in the <hi>way</hi> to heaven, or elſe againſt the doctrine of <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or, Thirdly, that theſe <hi>common</hi> graces do not really conſtitute a viſible Church, but this would be againſt what we have <hi>formerly</hi> proved.</p>
               <p>Or, Fourthly, and laſtly, that <hi>God</hi> is not the <hi>worker</hi> of theſe <hi>common</hi> effects by his <hi>Word,</hi> which would indeed be againſt <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>

                  <hi>The Argument from</hi> Chriſt <hi>as the</hi> head <hi>of the viſible Church.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe <hi>ſecond</hi> Argument from the <hi>efficient</hi> is taken from <hi>Christ</hi> as the cauſe <hi>efficient</hi> of the viſible Church according to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,</hi> or as he is the <hi>head</hi> thereof. Thus,</p>
               <p>Chriſt, may be conſidered to be <hi>truely the head</hi> of the viſible Church without reſpect to <hi>ſaving influence;</hi> therefore, the viſible Church may be conſidered to be truely his <hi>body</hi> without reſpect to ſaving grace.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of the <hi>connexion,</hi> here, is moſt evident; but I muſt needs confeſſe, that the antecedent requires, as well a <hi>modeſt</hi> inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, as <hi>ſtrong</hi> demonſtration; ſeeing it is eaſily noted to croſſe many plain expreſſions of <hi>eminent</hi> Divines.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>antecedent,</hi> there are two diſtinct branches, Firſt, that Chriſt is the head of the viſible Church, this paſſeth. Secondly, that he may be ſo conſidered without <hi>[neceſſary]</hi> reſpect to ſaving influence, this is my <hi>task;</hi> which I ſhall humbly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake after I have gotten a faire underſtanding with my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therein.</p>
               <p>For I deſire, it may be heeded, that I do not affirm, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt doth performe the office of a <hi>head fully,</hi> without <hi>ſaving influence,</hi> but (as it is expreſſed) <hi>truely (i. e.)</hi> in <hi>ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure truely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It may be alſo obſerved, that, <hi>truely,</hi> here, ſtands not in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to <hi>myſtically,</hi> but to <hi>falſly,</hi> or to <hi>ſeemingly</hi> onely; for though our Divines do uſually mean by the <hi>myſtical</hi> body, the Church <hi>inviſible,</hi> yet doubtleſſe Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> (as is well noted of him by others alſo) doth not ſpeak <hi>improperly,</hi> when he termes a <hi>particular viſible Church,</hi> a <hi>myſticall</hi> body; and if that be granted, the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, though <hi>not particular,</hi> may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo challenge the <hi>ſame</hi> title; and if the viſible Church be granted to be the <hi>myſtical</hi> body of Chriſt, then Chriſt may be ſaid to be its <hi>myſtical head.</hi> Beſides, if Chriſt be indeed the <hi>head</hi> of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118938:41"/> 
                  <hi>viſible</hi> Church, as none do doubt; and if he be not the head thereof, as it is <hi>Phyſically</hi> or <hi>Mathematically</hi> taken, which none will affirme, who can deny but that he is ſo <hi>Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Further may it be noted, that it is not ſaid, that Chriſt doth performe the office of an <hi>head</hi> to the Church, <hi>truely</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>ſaving</hi> influence, in <hi>any other</hi> conſideration, but as it is the <hi>viſible</hi> Church; for if any will aſſert a Church <hi>inviſible,</hi> I am not bound at all, to follow him, and ſay that this Church <hi>inviſible,</hi> alſo, hath <hi>true influence</hi> from its <hi>head,</hi> Chriſt, which is not <hi>ſaving;</hi> a thing not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
               <p>4. Laſtly, neither do I offer to ſay, that Chriſt is the head of his body <hi>viſible, without ſaving</hi> influence; but that he may be ſo conſidered, without <hi>reſpect</hi> thereunto; ſeeing there are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences</hi> not <hi>ſaving.</hi> which yet deſcend from Chriſt, as the <hi>head</hi> upon his <hi>body,</hi> the Church; and upon many of the members thereof that ſhall <hi>never be ſaved;</hi> and this is enough for my preſent purpoſe, becauſe in whatſoever ſenſe, Chriſt may be ſaid to leave the influence of a <hi>head</hi> upon his Church; the Church may in the <hi>ſame</hi> ſenſe, be ſaid to be his <hi>body;</hi> and if it ſhall truely be made to appear, that Chriſt doth <hi>really</hi> performe the office of the <hi>head,</hi> when he doth <hi>not</hi> give <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, it will thence eaſily follow, of it ſelfe, that the Church may be conſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed to be <hi>truely</hi> his <hi>body,</hi> without reſpect thereunto.</p>
               <p>Now, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be conſidered to be <hi>thus truely</hi> the head of the viſible Church, <hi>without reſpect to ſaving grace,</hi> I think, appeareth thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Chriſt truely diſpenſeth <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>graces (not ſaving)</hi> to the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, and to many particular members thereof, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>1</label> that ſhall never be ſaved, as he is a <hi>head:</hi> therefore he may be conſidered to be truely the <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſaving influence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Antecedent</hi> (which is, <hi>alone,</hi> to be proved) hath three parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Chriſt doth <hi>truely</hi> diſpenſe <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>graces</hi> not <hi>ſaving</hi> to the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, which none that know, what the <hi>gifts</hi> of <hi>prayer, preaching, healing, &amp;c.</hi> or what the <hi>graces</hi> of <hi>illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,

               <p>The <hi>Antecedent, viz.</hi> that <hi>members of the viſible Church may</hi> be conſidered, to be truely members of Chriſt without reſpect to <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, appears. 1.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Perſons may be conſidered to be truely called to the work of the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> without reſpect to ſaving grace; for <hi>Judas</hi> was truely called to the work of the Miniſtry, as is undeniable inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by that queſtion of our Saviour <hi>[have not I choſen you twelve?] (i. e.)</hi> have not, I my ſelf put you <hi>twelve</hi> into my <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry?</hi> yet 'tis known that <hi>Judas</hi> was not <hi>ſavingly called</hi> to be a <hi>member</hi> of Chriſt, as the next words added by our Saviour note, [and <hi>one of you is a Devil</hi>] which our Saviour, doubtleſſe knew,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118938:42"/> when he firſt choſe him, and would never have choſe him, had <hi>ſaving grace</hi> been <hi>eſſential</hi> to a <hi>true</hi> and lawful <hi>call</hi> to the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, it hence alſo follows, that perſons may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be <hi>truely members</hi> of Chriſt, without reſpect to ſaving grace; for can any one poſſibly think, that Chriſt would chooſe an <hi>infidel</hi> remaining ſuch, <hi>to rule his Church?</hi> or make him an officer over, that is not <hi>one,</hi> of his people? or put him into the place of the <hi>ſteward</hi> of his <hi>houſe,</hi> whom he yet hath not, and whom he never intends to put <hi>into his houſe?</hi> who doubts, but that he that is a <hi>Ruler, Officer,</hi> or <hi>Steward</hi> over the <hi>Church, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> or <hi>houſe of Chriſt,</hi> is alſo a <hi>member</hi> thereof, and <hi>much more?</hi> and that he that is a member of the Church, people, and houſe of Chriſt is alſo a member of <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe?</p>

                  <hi>ſaving</hi> grace; for, as <hi>Ames</hi> teacheth us, if they are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of any grace, it is done by force of the <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> and thus both the Covenant and the firſt <hi>ſeal</hi> of the Covenant belongs alſo to them, not as having true grace, but as borne <hi>to God,</hi> and in Covenant with him by their parents, and if it be ſo with us when <hi>infants,</hi> I ſhall humbly ask <hi>anone</hi> why not ſo <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?</hi> and in our <hi>adult</hi> eſtate? if born Chriſtians, and if we do not <hi>renounce Chriſtianity.</hi>

               <p>Then hence it alſo follows, that perſons may be conſidered to be <hi>truely members of Chriſt,</hi> without reſpect to ſaving grace; for into what are perſons <hi>baptized,</hi> but into <hi>the body</hi> of Chriſt? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. yea, and though afterwards, they prove <hi>ungodly,</hi> yet are they dealt with both <hi>here</hi> and <hi>hereafter</hi> as within, and as <hi>children of the Kingdome here,</hi> they have puniſhment <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>ſubjects</hi> and <hi>members</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> to be <hi>caſt out,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; if after <hi>admonition,</hi> they remaine <hi>obſtinate,</hi> then, if they <hi>repent,</hi> and are re-accepted, into <hi>communion</hi> with the Church, they are ſtill dealt with as <hi>within,</hi> and are not required to be <hi>re-baptized;</hi> and if they ſhall <hi>die</hi> in their <hi>wickedneſſe;</hi> they ſhall be <hi>judged</hi> hereafter and proceeded againſt, not as the <hi>children</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. The firſt is taken from the <hi>metaphorical termes</hi> of <hi>body</hi> and <hi>head,</hi> and may be formed thus. That member which hath <hi>not life in it ſelf,</hi> though it be yet <hi>united</hi> to the <hi>body</hi> is not <hi>truely</hi> a member of that body; <hi>unde equivocè agunt membra tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bui cadaveribus,</hi> as <hi>Shibler</hi> ſaith. But wicked men have <hi>no life</hi> in themſelves; therefore they are not <hi>truely</hi> but onely <hi>aequivocally</hi> members of the body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To the propoſition which hath firſt its <hi>proper,</hi> and ſecondly, its <hi>metaphorical</hi> ſenſe. I allow it in its <hi>proper,</hi> but I deny it in its <hi>metaphorical</hi> ſenſe, or in this rigid application <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In omni para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola—Hoc te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendum eſt ut utamur parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, tanquam picta tabella.—Itaque re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendenda eſt illa anxiet as &amp; ſollicitudoeorum qui in parabolis Chriſti omnia, ſtudent reſccare ad vivum, quod eſt non inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretari ſed vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant</hi> Camero. praelect. in Mat. 18. 8.</note> of it.</p>
               <p>It is a general complaint, by thoſe that ſee how much it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, That men are apt to receive apprehenſions about the <hi>mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal union</hi> betwixt Chriſt and his members, from the <hi>natural u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> betwixt the natural head and body. Certainly a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor may be preſſ'd to death, ſo farre as the Scriptures apply this metaphor of <hi>head</hi> and <hi>members,</hi> to Chriſt and his Church, we may ſafely venture; but further, though it may be true, it will not <hi>bear an argument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That I have good ground, thus to except againſt the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I leave, in one word, to the determination of all, but <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts;</hi> for, if this be a <hi>true</hi> propoſition, that, <hi>none can be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a member of the body of Chriſt,</hi> that hath not ſpiritual life <hi>in himſelf;</hi> then of neceſſity it followeth, that the <hi>children of the holieſt parents in the world,</hi> are not to be accounted <hi>truely mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of the body of Chriſt, from their <hi>parents holineſſe,</hi> ſeeing that is the life that is in the <hi>parent,</hi> and is not <hi>inhering</hi> in the <hi>childe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but onely <hi>relative</hi> to it; the childe hath not this life <hi>in its ſelf</hi> but in <hi>another,</hi> and therefore, according to this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition 'tis not a <hi>true,</hi> but onely an <hi>aequivocal</hi> member of Chriſt, if we but once grant, in the ſenſe intended, that it is an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial requiſite to every member, <hi>ut vitam habeat in ſe,</hi> that it <note place="margin">

But we may let the <hi>Metaphor</hi> hold, if we diſtinguiſh of <hi>life</hi> in the <hi>minor;</hi> which may with <hi>favour</hi> of my reader, be conceived to be ſuch as is a <hi>neceſſary requiſite</hi> to <hi>viſible</hi> Church-memberſhip: or ſuch as is a neceſſary requiſite to <hi>ſaving</hi> or (if
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:118938:44"/> you had rather) <hi>inviſible</hi> Church-memberſhip; if you pleaſe you may call the firſt an <hi>eccleſiaſtical,</hi> or <hi>political</hi> life; the laſt, a <hi>ſaving</hi> or a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> life.</p>
               <p>If the objection, meaning in the <hi>minor,</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, then I <hi>deny</hi> it, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>wicked men have no life in themſelves;</hi> for it is very evident, that wicked men have <hi>ſo much life</hi> in themſelves (if any be requiſite) as is <hi>eſſential</hi> to <hi>viſible</hi> Church memberſhip. I confeſſe, <hi>life,</hi> is ſomewhat unuſually attributed to wicked men, and to aſcribe it to them, as <hi>ſuch,</hi> is a contradiction; ſeeing, <hi>quatenus</hi> wicked, they are <hi>dead;</hi> yet ſeeing, they are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a <hi>double</hi> reſpect, 1.

               </p>
               <p>1. I conceive that <hi>Zanchy,</hi> did not intend, by theſe words, that they were not <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>viſible,</hi> but of the <hi>inviſible</hi> Church; which I have obſerved to be the general meaning of our <hi>reformed</hi> Divines, when they ſpeak of the <hi>members of Chriſt,</hi> inſomuch, that there is almoſt <hi>ground</hi> to think for one that is well accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their <hi>writing;</hi> they diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> and the <hi>members of Chriſt;</hi> as they alſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attribute, two other termes, <hi>viz.

                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:118938:45"/> are given by them to the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, and therefore not likely to be ſo here; and if he meant of the Church <hi>inviſible,</hi> 'tis nothing to our queſtion.</p>
               <p>Again, another <hi>reaſon</hi> why <hi>Zanchy</hi> may be thought here, to ſpeak onely of the Church <hi>inviſible,</hi> offers it ſelf from the <hi>ſcope</hi> of the place; for he is evidently ſtriking at the <hi>Papiſts</hi> exceſſive <hi>errour,</hi> touching the <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, as if every one that had the honour to be a member thereof, was thereby a member of the <hi>Church</hi> of the ſaved, which <hi>Zanchy</hi> ſeemeth to anticipate, as other our Divines in the like caſe, aſſerting that there are <hi>reprobates</hi> and <hi>hypocrites</hi> in the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, and <hi>theſe</hi> are not to be thence concluded, to be <hi>real members</hi> of Chriſts <hi>(inviſible, myſtical)</hi> body, or in a <hi>ſtate of ſalvation;</hi> and thus <hi>membra ſunt ſatanae non Chriſti,</hi> quoting that place, that is <hi>ſeldom,</hi> if <hi>ever</hi> interpreted of the members of the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, <hi>viz. they were not of us,</hi> 1 John 2. 19. for confirmation thereof, and that his ſecret bent is againſt <hi>the Papiſt,</hi> as I have ſaid, is more then intimated by his next words, <hi>quicunque ſpiritum habent non Chriſti ſed Antichriſti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much for his <hi>ſenſe;</hi> now for his <hi>reaſon</hi> here, that <hi>one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be both a member of Chriſt, and a member of Satan; but wicked men are members of Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer. 1. By <hi>conceſſion;</hi> for it is moſt true, one cannot be both a member of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and a member of <hi>Satan,</hi> at the ſame <hi>time,</hi> and in the ſame <hi>reſpect,</hi> one cannot be a member of Chriſts <note place="margin">Is it then poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the ſelf ſame men ſhould belong both to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and to the Church of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt?

               </p>
               <p>But, Secondly, by way of <hi>exception.</hi> I anſwer further, that the ſame <hi>perſon,</hi> may at the very ſame inſtant of <hi>time,</hi> be <hi>both</hi> a member of Chriſt, and a member of Satan in <hi>divers reſpects;</hi> he may be a member of Satan <hi>internally,</hi> and a member of Chriſt <hi>externally,</hi> and yet, both, <hi>really;</hi> a member of Satan <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,</hi> a member of Chriſt <hi>relatively,</hi> a member of Satan by <hi>obedience,</hi> a member of Chriſt by <hi>profeſſion,</hi> a member of Chriſt by <hi>Covenant,</hi> a member of Satan by <hi>ſervice.</hi> Laſtly, a member of Chriſt his <hi>viſible Kingdome,</hi> and a member of Satans <hi>inviſible Kingdome;</hi> and both really and <hi>truely</hi> ſo; as a <hi>man</hi> that is <hi>openly</hi> and really the husband of an <hi>honeſt wife,</hi> may

               </p>
               <p>But now, the viſible Church may be conſidered, <hi>truely</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to have its end, without reſpect to ſaving grace; therefore, alſo its being.</p>

               <p>Firſt, the <hi>ends</hi> of the viſible Church, is <hi>ultimately</hi> the <hi>glory of God</hi> in the <hi>world;</hi> and more <hi>immediately,</hi> his <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> in the <hi>world;</hi> the great <hi>meanes</hi> of the <hi>former, viz.</hi> his glory,

               <p>HItherto of the <hi>external</hi> cauſes of the viſible Church, and the <hi>Arguments</hi> thence ariſing; let us now conſider the cauſes thereof remaining, which are called <hi>internal,</hi> viz. the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>matter</hi> of the viſible Church in general, I argue thus.</p>
               <p>The <hi>viſible</hi> Church may be conſidered <hi>truely</hi> to have the <hi>matter</hi> of the Church of Chriſt, without reſpect to <hi>ſaving</hi> grace.</p>
               <p>Therefore to be <hi>truely</hi> a <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt without reſpect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; This <hi>conſequence,</hi> ſimply taken, I confeſſe is not ſo war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, becauſe the <hi>matter</hi> doth <hi>prae-exiſt</hi> before, and remaine ſometimes <hi>after</hi> the <hi>forme;</hi> yet take it reſpectively to the forme afterwards to be maintained, and to the <hi>queſtion</hi> in controverſie, which is chiefly concerning the <hi>matter</hi> of the Church, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the <hi>opinion</hi> of my <hi>preſent</hi> Opponents; we readily affirm that all the <hi>queſtion</hi> is about the <hi>matter</hi> of the Church, that if this be <hi>fained,</hi> ſo is our <hi>Church;</hi> and if this be <hi>real,</hi> ſo is our <hi>Church,</hi> and I doubt not but it will paſſe without <hi>interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, the thing that I am diſpatching, doth not engage me for the <hi>conſequence,</hi> though the other <hi>cauſes</hi> have been found ſo <hi>pregnant</hi> as to <hi>bear</hi> ſuch a particular <hi>improvement;</hi> onely to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne and maintain to the <hi>viſible</hi> Church all its <hi>cauſes,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its <hi>exiſtence truely</hi> ſo, in our conſideration, without reſpect to <hi>ſaving</hi> grace; which, I preſume, <hi>hath</hi> been done already, as to the <hi>Authour,</hi> the <hi>Head,</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> of the Church, to which I now proceed to add, the <hi>matter</hi> thereof, affirming (as before in the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent</hi> (that the viſible Church may be conſidered to have the <hi>true matter</hi> of the Church of Chriſt without reſpect to <hi>ſaving</hi> grace.</p>

               <p>1. The <hi>matter</hi> of the viſible Church having the <hi>reaſon</hi> of the <hi>parts,</hi> is, the <hi>Miniſters</hi> and the <hi>people,</hi> the <hi>paſtors</hi> and the <hi>flock, eccleſia utens,</hi> and <hi>eccleſia docens,</hi> as ſome ſpeak, and as we read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>both</hi> making up the <hi>compoſitum,</hi> the <hi>Church;</hi> and <hi>this Church</hi> muſt needs be the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, for there are no ſuch <hi>organical</hi> parts; no <hi>Miniſter</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf in the Church <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, may we conſider, <hi>both</hi> theſe <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>matter</hi> of the Church, as <hi>truely</hi> ſuch, without reſpect to ſaving grace? did not <hi>Judas truely teach,</hi> and do not thouſands <hi>truely profeſſe</hi> in the Church of Chriſt, being <hi>truely called,</hi> though not <hi>ſavingly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,</hi> without any meaſure of ſaving grace? but, <hi>this</hi> will more fitly <hi>meet</hi> us in the <hi>next</hi> conſideration of the <hi>matter</hi> of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> as having the reaſon the <hi>ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, we enquire what the <hi>ſubject matter</hi> of the viſible is, and whether it alſo may be conſidered without reſpect to ſaving grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is rhen the <hi>ſubject matter</hi> of the viſible Church? <hi>Trel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catius</hi> tells us, that it is <hi>all ſuch as are called out,</hi> and <hi>externally profeſſe the faith;</hi> which, I think, none can chooſe but approve of, when they conſider that <hi>faith</hi> is a thing <hi>inviſible,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not any way fitted to commend the <hi>matter</hi> of the Church to us, as <hi>viſible,</hi> and though it be granted that <hi>faith</hi> doth <hi>unite</hi> men to the Church, yet it muſt ſtill be yeelded, that <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> thereof doth render them members of the Church as <hi>viſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But here, ſeeing moſt do conſent that <hi>profeſſors</hi> of the <hi>faith</hi> are the ſubject <hi>matter</hi> of the viſible Church, it will, I preſume, be worth our <hi>enquirie,</hi> what is meant by the <hi>faith</hi> ſo <hi>profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> Certainly, it muſt be either the <hi>doctrine,</hi> or the <hi>grace</hi> of faith; and <hi>which</hi> of theſe is <hi>properly,</hi> or <hi>uſual,</hi> ſaid to be <hi>profeſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Is it the grace of faith which men profeſſe? certainly no,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:118938:48"/> for that is the <hi>faith by which,</hi> and not the faith which we profeſs. 2. How <hi>incongruous</hi> a ſpeech would it be to ſay, I profeſſe <hi>that I believe,</hi> while it is good and ſound, and <hi>reliſhing</hi> upon the <hi>minde</hi> of the hearer, to ſay, I profeſſe <hi>what,</hi> or that doctrine which <hi>I do beleeve.</hi> 3. If the meaning was that we do profeſſe the <hi>grace</hi> of faith, then the <hi>Epithite, true,</hi> which Divines do ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally annex to <hi>faith,</hi> ſhould be put to <hi>profeſſion,</hi> and whereas they uſually ſpeak of the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of the <hi>true faith,</hi> they ſhould ſhould ſay, the <hi>true profeſſion</hi> of the <hi>faith.</hi> 4. This appeares in its <hi>contrary</hi> out of doubt; for <hi>ſuch</hi> as <hi>fall</hi> away from the <hi>faith,</hi> are not ſaid to deny their own faith, but the <hi>faith</hi> or doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then it is <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> which we <hi>profeſſe,</hi> as members of the <hi>viſible</hi> Church; and if this be the <hi>note</hi> or character of the <hi>matter</hi> of the viſible Church, it can, in the moſt ſtrict and rigid ſenſe, that can poſſibly be put upon it, onely require <hi>two</hi> things; <hi>truth</hi> in the <hi>object</hi> profeſſed, and <hi>truth</hi> in the <hi>ſubject</hi> profeſſing, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> that he <hi>profeſſe</hi> the <hi>true doctrine</hi> of faith, and that he <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> what he <hi>profeſſeth, (i. e.)</hi> that he have a <hi>good profeſſion,</hi> and that he have a <hi>good principle</hi> anſwering to it; ſuch a <hi>faith</hi> as ſuch a <hi>profeſſion</hi> doth require, to make it not <hi>diſſembled,</hi> but <hi>true</hi> and real; and thus, though we do not <hi>profeſſe</hi> the <hi>grace</hi> of faith, yet the <hi>grace</hi> of faith ſo farre is <hi>conſented</hi> to, as is requiſite to a <hi>true profeſſion,</hi> ſeeing <hi>thereby</hi> we <hi>truely beleeve</hi> what we ſo <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet though this <hi>faith</hi> is ſuppoſed to be <hi>true</hi> where the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the Church is <hi>true;</hi> the <hi>matter</hi> of the Church doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its denomination of <hi>being true,</hi> from the <hi>truth</hi> of this grace of faith, but from the truth of its object or <hi>doctrine beleeved,</hi> and accordingly <hi>profeſſed</hi> which, as alſo what was before aſſerted <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>doctrine</hi> of faith is the <hi>object</hi> of proper profeſſion, or the faith properly <hi>profeſſed,</hi> appears by abundant <hi>example</hi> in <hi>Scripture.</hi> The <hi>Eunuch</hi> being being demanded, <hi>doſt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve?</hi> anſwered not, my faith is ſincere, but <hi>I beleeve that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>

               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:118938:49"/>
               <p> But moſt remarkable is that eminent <hi>profeſſion</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Id eſt, ſuper hauc firmam confeſſionem tuam, qua con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteris &amp; credis me eſſe Chriſtum filium Dei vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventis, edificabo eccleſiam meam.</hi> as Bucer in loc.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Chriſt, then it ſeems will build his Church upon this rock of profeſſion, of the <hi>doctrine</hi> of faith, and ſuch as are built thereupon, are true ſtones in his houſe, and the true ſubject matter of his viſible Church, and thoſe that require a profeſſion of the grace of juſtifying faith, or of ſaving grace, as neceſſary to our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the viſible Church, ſeem to <hi>lay another foundation</hi> thereof, then <hi>Chriſt himſelf hath laid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, anſwerable hereunto, is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>being built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, (i. e.)</hi> (as <hi>Bullinger</hi> teacheth) upon their <hi>doctrine,</hi> not <hi>their grace,</hi> nor yet <note place="margin">Eph. 2. ult.</note> our <hi>own;</hi> not as if the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> were the <hi>foundation</hi> of the Church in their <hi>perſons:</hi> yet it ſeems they were ſo, in their <hi>doctrine; which</hi> was indeed the doctrine of that one <hi>foundation,</hi> other then which none may lay, <hi>viz. Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore accordingly, the <hi>true</hi> viſible Church hath ever, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, been <hi>argued</hi> and knowne by the <hi>truth of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> which it hath profeſſed, and not by the <hi>truth</hi> of its <hi>graces.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The viſible Church may be conſidered to have a <hi>real conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive forme,</hi> without reſpect to ſaving grace; therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to be <hi>truely a Church of Chriſt</hi> without reſpect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>The <hi>conſequence</hi> muſt needs be yeelded me, becauſe its <hi>contrary</hi> implies a <hi>contradiction;</hi> for to ſay, that any thing hath a real <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive forme,</hi> is as much as to ſay, that it really and <hi>formally is;</hi> therefore, to deny that any thing hath not really or <hi>truely</hi> a being, is <hi>formally</hi> to <hi>contradict</hi> its having a real <hi>conſtitutive forme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then nothing but the <hi>minor</hi> requires proof, which is, <hi>that the viſible Church hath a reali conſtitutive forme, which hath no neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dependance upon,</hi> and may conſequently be conſidered without reſpect unto <hi>ſaving grace; which,</hi> I preſume, will <hi>appear</hi> upon a ſhort and eaſie <hi>debate.</hi>

               <p>If I may be modeſt and yet bold, I ſhould be bold to ſay that <hi>Ameſius</hi> ſeemed here in a ſtrait betwixt two; he was loath to ſay, that external profeſſours wanting <hi>true</hi> grace, were true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of Chriſt, therefore, ſaith he, they are not ſo, <hi>quoad ſtatum internum aut eſſentialem,</hi> and yet as loath to ſay, they were not truely ſo, and therefore ſaith, they are <hi>membra eccleſiae quoad ſtatum externum;</hi> the Papiſt held the one, and the Browniſt the other, how then dare he or we hold either? the Papiſt was ready to charge him with <hi>Browniſme</hi> for denying hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites to be members of the Church; he anſwers them, that hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are ſo according to the outward ſtate of the Church; the <hi>Browniſt</hi> was as ready to charge him with <hi>Popery,</hi> in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wicked men to be true members of the viſible Church, and he anſwers them that they are not ſo, <hi>quoad statum internum</hi> and <hi>eſſentialem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us weigh his words a little farther, by fixing the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether any thing may be conſidered as <hi>ſuch,</hi> from its

               <p>But may a man be conſidered <hi>qua homo,</hi> from the figure or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his body? or any member of that man be conſidered ſuch from its partaking of <hi>either</hi> of theſe? if by the eſſential form alone a thing is that which it is, can any thing partake of the being of that thing without partaking of the <hi>eſſential form?</hi> do not the Schooles generally with <hi>Thomas</hi> teach that <hi>forma accidentalis non tribuit perfectionem eſſentialem compoſito?</hi> would not the affirmative to this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the accident perfects the eſſence (ſeeing <hi>accidens habet eſſe in ſubjecto,)</hi> be a flat contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction? How then can <hi>Ameſius</hi> ſay, that one that onely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the accidental forme of the Church, is a member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? either we muſt allow, that ſuch profeſſours are true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church, or deny them to be ſo; if they are, they muſt needs partake of the eſſential form of the body, and not onely of the accidental, if they are not, let us be rigid <hi>Browniſts,</hi> and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay what we think.</p>
               <p>Yea, if ſuch profeſſours do truely partake of the accidental form of the Church, I conceive they muſt alſo truly partaker of the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; intereſt in the accident of any thing is founded in intereſt, in the eſſence of that thing; for an accident, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> hath no being but in its ſubject, and there cannot be an intereſt in, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to any thing, but <hi>as it is;</hi> how then can a man ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the accidental forme of the Church, unleſſe he be <hi>pars ſubjecti vel ſubſtantiae?</hi> and how can that be, unleſſe he partake of the <hi>eſſential,</hi> or ſubſtantial forme of the Church.</p>
               <p>How can any thing partake of my <hi>colour,</hi> or figure, unleſſe it be <hi>part of my ſelfe?</hi> it may partake of <hi>whiteneſſe,</hi> but not of <hi>my</hi> whiteneſſe, or of whiteneſſe as an <hi>accident</hi> of me, unleſſe it be part of me; ſo, indeed, a man may be a <hi>profeſſor,</hi> but he cannot partake of the profeſſion of the <hi>Church,</hi> unleſs he be a real part of the <hi>ſubject,</hi> the Church, which cannot be without partaking with the eſſence or eſſential forme thereof.</p>
               <p>So that here I pitch, ſuch profeſſours are members of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church <hi>farther</hi> then <hi>Ames</hi> alloweth, or <hi>not</hi> ſo <hi>farre;</hi> for they partake either of both the eſſential and accidental forme or of

                  <hi>the Sacraments</hi> are the <hi>formal cauſe</hi> of the Church.</p>
               <p>But theſe, I conceive, are rather either the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>communion,</hi> which is, as was ſaid before, the <hi>formal action,</hi> more properly, then the very <hi>forme</hi> it ſelfe, of the Church; or elſe the <hi>diſtinguiſhing forme,</hi> whereby the Church is known rather then the <hi>conſtitutive</hi> form, whereby the Church hath its <hi>being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to draw up this diſcourſe of the <hi>conſtitutive forme</hi> of the Church. 1. Whatſoever it appear to be, I hope to prove that it may be truely conſidered without reſpect to ſaving grace, if it be <hi>calling,</hi> or <hi>faith,</hi> or <hi>profeſſion;</hi> it hath before appeared, that theſe may be conſidered to be <hi>truely,</hi> when not ſavingly ſuch; and if it be ſociety or community, as hath partly appeared already (and will more fully appear when we handle the <hi>definition</hi> of the Church) I preſume none will queſtion, but this alſo, may be conſidered to be <hi>truely</hi> ſuch without any reſpect to ſaving grace.</p>
               <p>2. But if <hi>Ames</hi> ſhould mean as he truely ſeemeth to do, that <hi>coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus vocatorum,</hi> or <hi>ſocietas fidelium,</hi> in an united and conjunct ſenſe, is the forme of the Church; that is, neither the <hi>called,</hi> nor <hi>ſociety,</hi> but theſe both together, as a company or ſociety of the called, or the faithful; though then we know not, as before was ſaid, where to finde the <hi>matter</hi> of the Church, and that the whole <hi>defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi> will be taken up in the <hi>form,</hi> and conſequently, we may not <hi>grant</hi> it; yet, I conceive, we may ſafely give it; for the viſible Church, may be as well conſidered to be a ſociety of perſons <hi>called conjunctively,</hi> as <hi>perſons called,</hi> and a <hi>ſociety without</hi> reſpect to ſaving grace.</p>
               <p>3. And although we ſhould farther give him, that which alſo we have before denyed to grant him, <hi>viz.</hi> that that <hi>faith</hi> which is the <hi>eſſential</hi> forme of the Church, is a <hi>ſaving</hi> faith; yet he is pleaſed freely to <hi>recompenſe</hi> us again with with as much in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that perſons that are onely <hi>externally called,</hi> and ſuch, as one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſe (as himſelf ſpeaks) are truely <hi>members of the Church of Chriſt,</hi> according to the <hi>outward ſtate</hi> thereof, or as it is a <hi>viſible</hi> Church, which is freely acknowledged to be all, that is neceſſarily ſought in the <hi>preſent controverſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Indeed, he alſo adds, that ſuch <hi>profeſſion,</hi> and outward calling is but the <hi>accidental</hi> form of the Church (as before) which <hi>aſſertion,</hi> we conceive, will hardly bear this his <hi>concluſion,</hi> however, <hi>this</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto us.

               <p>WE now deſcend to the other branch of the <hi>formal</hi> cauſe, called <hi>diſtinguens vel diſcriminans;</hi> contained in thoſe <hi>notes</hi> or marks, whereby the Church is known <hi>to be true</hi> and diſtinguiſhed from a <hi>falſe</hi> Church. Whence the <hi>Argument</hi> is this.</p>
               <p>The <hi>notes</hi> or marks of a true Church may be conſidered to be <hi>truely</hi> ſuch without <hi>reſpect</hi> to <hi>ſaving</hi> grace; therefore the <hi>Church</hi> her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>None will venture upon the <hi>conſequence,</hi> for if thoſe very things <hi>(viz.</hi> the <hi>notes)</hi> whereby alone, we take to our ſelves a conſideration of the <hi>Churches being</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> cannot be affirmed to have any dependance upon <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, then, certainly, the Church may be conſidered to be truely ſuch without reſpect to ſaving grace.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Antecedent</hi> appears by an eaſie <hi>induction</hi> of the <hi>notes</hi> and marks of a true Church.</p>
               <p>They are either <hi>eſſential</hi> or <hi>accidental;</hi> it is generally agreed, <note place="margin">

               <p>But this <hi>profeſſion</hi> of the <hi>true</hi> faith (I humbly conceive, if we ſpeak exactly) as it is a <hi>mark</hi> of the true Church, muſt be taken

                  <hi>eccleſiaſtically</hi> and not <hi>perſonally;</hi> for there may be a <hi>private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal</hi> owning and profeſſion of the faith, where there is no <hi>formal,</hi> proper and exact <hi>Church;</hi> and there, we cannot affirme <hi>profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of the faith an <hi>eſſential note</hi> of the true Church; <hi>perſonal profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> I grant is a certaine <hi>mark</hi> of a <hi>member</hi> of the Church <hi>(i. e.)</hi> univerſal, and <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> profeſſion of the Church it ſelf.</p>
               <p>This <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> profeſſion (I conceive) conſiſts in <hi>attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> upon the Ordinance of divine <hi>worſhip,</hi> and is rather a <hi>real,</hi> then a <hi>vocal</hi> profeſſion; for the end of the viſible Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing properly the worſhip of God, the note thereof is properly, that which renders it <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to its <hi>end,</hi> which is attendance upon <hi>thoſe things</hi> which are ordained for that <hi>end,</hi> the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>worſhip.</hi>

May not <hi>perſonal</hi> vocal profeſſion be made without ſaving <note place="margin">We are to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Church of Chriſt more or leſſe corrupt according to the greater or leſſe abuſe of Gods Word and worſhip. <hi>Bp.

                  </note> grace? and the truth be <hi>profeſſed,</hi> as well as <hi>beleeved,</hi> where ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace is wanting? 2. May not <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> profeſſion, whether more <hi>formally</hi> by a ſolemn <hi>Creed</hi> read, and ſilently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto by the people, be alſo done, and conſidered without any reſpect to ſaving grace in the declarer or conſenters. 3. Or that other real profeſſion conſiſting in attendance upon the Ordinances of God, be conſidered to have truth for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject both in Word and Sacraments, and yet without reſpect to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving graces?</p>
               <p>Againe, the <hi>accidental notes</hi> of the Church, are alſo generally acknowledged to be of two ſorts, <hi>inſeparable</hi> or proper, and <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> or common.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſeparable</hi> and proper notes of a true Church are ſaid to be the <hi>pure preaching</hi> of the Word, and the lawful adminiſtration of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which are but the <hi>meanes</hi> or actions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance and application of the foreſaid <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>both,</hi> unto the Church, and ſo near unto the profeſſion thereof, which was ſaid before to be the eſſential mark of the Church, that I have already reduced it thither, and need not repeat it here againe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſeparable</hi> notes of the Church, whatſoever they be, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conclude any thing againſt me; becauſe they are ſuch, I meane, <hi>ſeparable,</hi> and therefore not <hi>neceſſary</hi> in our conſideration of the being of the Church.</p>
               <p>However, that we leave not them onely untoucht, they are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually reduced unto two heads. 1. <hi>Eccleſiaſtical power.</hi> 2. And <hi>holineſs</hi> of life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eccleſiaſtical power</hi> hath three branches, the power of <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi> the power of <hi>Order,</hi> the power of <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> all which may eaſily be conſidered without the leaſt reſpect to ſaving grace. 1. <hi>Judas</hi> may truely exerciſe his <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> And, 2. Outward
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118938:57"/> 
                  <hi>Order</hi> may be fix'd and obſerved. And, 3. <hi>Diſcipline</hi> may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and diſpenſed without any neceſſary ſuppoſition of ſaving grace, either in the parties ſo diſpenſing, or in the objects (open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſcandalous)</hi> on which the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> is <hi>diſpenſed;</hi> as hath beene touched before, and will be more fully handled here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe, <hi>holineſs of life</hi> cometh neereſt, to ſhew its <hi>reſpect</hi> to ſaving grace; but this alſo ſhewes as much reſpect to my cauſe; as eaſily appeares by this <hi>[concluding]</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>If <hi>holineſs of life</hi> be ſeparable from a true Church, then <hi>ſaving grace</hi> is ſeparable from a true Church, for if a holy life doth not alwayes ſuppoſe ſaving, yet ſaving grace doth not always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a holy life.</p>
               <p>But, it is ſtill confeſſed, by <hi>thoſe</hi> which write moſt <hi>accurately</hi> on the Church, that <hi>holineſſe of life</hi> is a <hi>ſeparable</hi> accidental note, which is onely neceſſary to the <hi>order</hi> and welfare of the Church, and not to the <hi>being</hi> or truth thereof.</p>
               <p>Now, if ſaving grace be ſeparable from a true Church, then it may be conſidered to be truely ſuch, <hi>without reſpect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>HAving done with the <hi>cauſes,</hi> we proceed to the <hi>definition,</hi> whence we thus argue.</p>
               <p>The <hi>definition</hi> of the viſible Church doth not ſuppoſe ſaving <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </note> grace, therefore the definition, the viſible Church it ſelf, may be conſidered to be <hi>truely</hi> ſuch, without reſpect to ſaving grace, for the <hi>definition</hi> of a thing, is but that whereby the <hi>nature</hi> of that thing is declared or explicated, and is plainly <hi>convertible</hi> with the thing defined.</p>
               <p>Now whether the <hi>definition</hi> of the viſible Church be incluſive of ſaving grace, or not; may appear, Firſt, from the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſeverally conſidered. And, Secondly, by a view of ſuch defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Church, as are already given us by approved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours.</p>
               <p>1. The parts are three. 1. The ſpecial <hi>quality</hi> of the viſible Church. 2. Or the ſpecial <hi>work</hi> and employment thereof. Or, laſtly, the ſtate and condition wherein the Church ſo <hi>qualified</hi> is rendred <hi>capable</hi> of that <hi>employment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, let us look upon the ſpecial <hi>quality</hi> of the viſible Church, which may be conceived to be either the <hi>faith, calling,</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> thereof Whence by ſome the viſible Church is, in ſhort, defined to be, a company or ſociety of <hi>Beleevers;</hi> or a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men <hi>called</hi> by external vocation, or a company profeſſing the Chriſtian and true <hi>Religion;</hi> where the weight and empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis reſts upon the <hi>faithful,</hi> or the <hi>called,</hi> or <hi>profeſſors</hi> of the true Religion.</p>
               <p>My buſineſſe is not to defend or to except againſt any of theſe, either in their truth or <hi>fulneſs,</hi> but to propoſe, whether theſe and the like have any neceſſary dependance upon ſaving grace; which to affirme, I think, is not without evident danger.</p>
               <p>Here are two things reſt upon me, 1. That external <hi>calling,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:118938:58"/> 
                  <hi>profeſſion</hi> of the true religion, and faith have no neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon ſaving grace. 2. That theſe are true and real in their kinde as to viſible memberſhip, when not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>external calling;</hi> the very ſound and notion thereof, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Efficacitas vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationis, duplex una ſalutaris electorum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prio: altera non ſalutaris ad vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catos communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpectans.</hi> Inſt. Theol. p. 114.</note> ſufficiently proves its <hi>independency</hi> upon <hi>ſaving grace,</hi> and that as diſtinguiſhed from the inward and ſaving calling, it is true and real in its kinde, and indeed effectual, as <hi>Trelcatius</hi> notes, I ſuppoſe is ſufficiently argued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither can any doubt but that <hi>profeſſion</hi> of the <hi>true</hi> and Chriſtian religion is alſo generally done, without ſaving grace; and for its being yet a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real</hi> profeſſion, when not ſaving, this depends upon the truth of the faith, by which, or rather from which, this profeſſion is made, and which is next to be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore whereas the <hi>external calling,</hi> and the profeſſion of the faith, have both been largely handled before, and this common faith hath been often touched upon; as againe, will be frequent occaſion of hereafter; I ſhall, now once for all, humbly endeavour to prove, that there is a faith in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the uiſible Church, which is true and real in its kind, though not ſaving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. This appears, Firſt, from the <hi>authority.</hi> Secondly, from the <hi>reaſon</hi> of Scripture. 1. From Scripture-authority, thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture intimates, that all that are not <hi>Heathen</hi> are <hi>Beleevers,</hi> 1 Cor. 7 14. as even all affirme, that interpret the place againſt the Anabaptiſt; for indeed, the queſtion was not, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exiſtimant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formati, quod ſoedcralis quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam fanctitas qua jus habent illi qui hoc modo ſancti ſunt, ad media ſalutis &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum Baptiſmi, &amp; qua ab Ethnicis, Turcis, ſimilibuſque al iis infidelibus ſeperantur,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 14 <hi>Toti Nationi ſeu populo comunicetur, cui Deus tabulas ſui ſoederis ita imper. tit eaſdem ſuſcipiant, &amp; profiteantur, quos ad ſtatum viſibilis eccleſiae ſuae vocat &amp; ducit,</hi> Rom. 11. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Blakes</hi> Seals, p. 118. out of Apol.</note> touching continuance with ſuch as were wicked, if profeſſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but ſuch as were Heathens, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> out of the Church; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Infidel,</hi> or no Church-member and unbeliever, are ſynonimous; <hi>Let him be to thee as a Heathen,</hi> Mat. 18. <hi>is worſe than an Infidel,</hi> 1 Tit. 5. 8.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:118938:59"/>
               <p> But now there are may perſons within the Church, who though they are without ſaving grace may not be termed Heathens. 1. The ſcandal of perſons within may declare they have no ſaving grace, yet the puniſhment at laſt to be inflicted on ſuch, is but to put them into the ſtate of an Heathen, or to deal with them as with a Heathen or a Publican; therefore doubtleſs they were not Heathen before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the place before cited, a wicked Church-member is compared to an Infidel, or an Unbeleever <hi>(worſe then an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del;</hi> becauſe he profeſſeth and owneth the faith with his mouth which he denies and wounds by his ungodly life;) and he that is compared to an infidel; is thereby concluded to be no infidel; for a compariſon muſt needs be betwixt two; for it is as it were a compariſon, or a comparing things one with another; and he that is no <hi>Infidel</hi> or unbeleever, muſt needs be granted to be a <hi>beleever,</hi> or will be enforced from 2 Cor. 6. 15.

                  </gap>, with an infidel, or one without the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of which, the Scripture giveth us, a cleare inſtance in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus;</hi> it firſt affirmeth that he believed, and then wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, that he notwithſtanding was in the <hi>gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>

Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> notes three things, 1. Their faith, they are ſaid to beleeve for a ſeaſon. 2. The fruits of that faith, they received the Word with joy. 3.

Again, that this was a real faith, for he ſaith they fell away from it; they could not fall away from that which was not. Laſtly, in the <hi>time of temptation,</hi> implying, that <hi>before</hi> that time they might be truely ſaid to <hi>ſtand</hi> in the; elſe the <hi>blaſt</hi> of temptation could not have thrown them <hi>down;</hi> as alſo thoſe that <hi>made ſhipwrack</hi>

                  <hi>of faith,</hi> are ſuppoſed, 1. To have had the faith, elſe they could not have loſt it. 2. To have had no ſaving faith, for then they would not have made ſhipwrack of it.</p>
               <p>2. In the reaſon of the Scripture, it is alſo plaine, that there is a true faith which yet is not ſaving; whether we conſider it in a <hi>relative,</hi> or in a <hi>qualitative</hi> ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a relative or (if any had rather) a federal faith as well as holineſſe; allowed by all but Anabaptiſts upon the account of our parents Church-memberſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If any ſhould reply that this faith is in the parent, and not in the childe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I muſt have leave to deny it; an account of which I ſhall give more largely hereafter, in briefe here, thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The faith that is in the parent is a perſonal, habitual, or qualitative faith, this faith that relates to the childe is foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>childe</hi> is as truely the <hi>ſubject</hi> of this <hi>faith,</hi> which he hath by <hi>relation</hi> to his father, by <hi>grace,</hi> as of <hi>filiation</hi> or ſon-ſhip, which he hath alſo by <hi>relation</hi> from his father by <hi>nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Yea, this <hi>faith</hi> is more firmely ſeated in the childe, then his <note place="margin">One ſort of real holines conſiſts in a bare rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God and depends wholly upon birth within the pale of the Church, and the parents embracing the covenant. <hi>Blak.

If the <hi>viſible</hi> Church ſhould take its <hi>definition,</hi> rather from the ſaid <hi>qualifications,</hi> then from its <hi>communion</hi> in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, then would the Church be rather known from the <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of <hi>theſe</hi> qualifications, then from its <hi>communion</hi> in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; for that which <hi>flows</hi> moſt immediately from the <hi>eſſence</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:118938:62"/> of a thing into our apprehenſion and knowledge, cannot but be reckoned the moſt eſſential, and therfore, the beſt <hi>mark</hi> of that thing.</p>
               <p>But the Church, on the contrary, hath been ever better <hi>knowne</hi> and diſtinguiſhed by the <hi>Ordinances</hi> wherein it communicates, then from any <hi>perſonal qualities</hi> whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="1">1. Many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are not ſo <hi>civil</hi> as ſome <hi>Heathens,</hi> and many <hi>Heathens</hi> are not ſo <hi>profane</hi> as ſome <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> yet no <hi>Heathens</hi> do attend the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God, as Chriſtians do in their <hi>ſolemn aſſemblies.</hi>

This further appears if we well conſider the onely way, that God himſelf hath generally, if not <hi>ever,</hi> taken, <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>judicially</hi> to un-church a people; namely, by <hi>removing</hi> his <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> and not his <hi>graces,</hi> their faith, calling or profeſſion from them; Look over all the <hi>books</hi> and <hi>works</hi> of God; and ſee whether this can be queſtioned; <hi>the</hi> very <hi>people</hi> that murthered Chriſt, yet to them <hi>belongs the promiſe,</hi> Acts 2. and they are the <hi>ſeed of the Covenant,</hi> chap. 3. and ſo <hi>continue,</hi> notwithſtanding this height of all impiety untill the Miniſtry and Ordinances are <hi>turned from them to the Gentiles,</hi> Acts <hi>ult.</hi> 'tis granted that ſuch deſperate wickedneſſe doth not onely deſerve, that God ſhould <hi>ſpew a people out,</hi> but alſo it doth violently provoke him to it; yea, it is threatned with it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16.

               <p>
                  <hi>Conſ.</hi> 6. Yea, a <hi>people,</hi> have no other way to <hi>unchurch</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but by their <hi>voluntary breaking of their communion</hi> in the Ordinances of God, by <hi>hereſie, poyſoning</hi> them, and thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them die, and ceaſe to be Gods Ordinances; or <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> directly rejecting them, or by the perfection of both, in a <hi>total Apoſtaſie.</hi>

               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:118938:63"/>
               <p> But though <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> did ever unchurch a people <hi>demerito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riè,</hi> it never yet did unchurch a people <hi>formaliter vel effectivè,</hi> as will appear more anone.</p>
               <p>Yea, though <hi>Hereſie</hi> be indeed a renouncing the faith and ſchiſme, a renouncing the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of the faith, yet at preſent, I conceive, that <hi>hereſie</hi> doth properly and <hi>ſtrictly unchurch,</hi> as it denieth the faith, not, as <hi>it is the faith of Christ,</hi> but as it is, the <hi>foundation</hi> of this <hi>communion</hi> in the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <note place="margin">Being built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophets and Apoſtles.</note> and accordingly <hi>ſchiſme</hi> doth ſtictly unchurch, as it <hi>breaks</hi> off this <hi>communion,</hi> and not as it <hi>ceaſeth</hi> the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of the faith.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>breaking off</hi> from this communion, is moſt exactly and properly termed, <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> or a renting of the Church, and ungodlineſſe of heart or life, and indeed a ceaſing <hi>to profeſſe</hi> the faith, as <hi>ſuch,</hi> is not ſo properly or ſtictly <hi>ſchyſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſ.</hi> 7. Theſe <hi>qualifications,</hi> faith, holineſſe, calling, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, may all be found where there is no inſtituted or formed <hi>Church</hi> and (conſequently, to our congregational brethrens principles, who as Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> in the name of his brethren, phraſeth it, ſay, that the <hi>univerſal viſible Church is a Chimaera)</hi> where there is no formed viſible Church; wherein <hi>Ames</hi> is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, <hi>Fideles non conſtituant eccleſiam particularem, niſi ſpeciali</hi>

                  <hi>vinculo inter ſe conjungantur;</hi> which onely renders them capable of this <hi>communion;</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church being diſſolved; the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that were ſaved, were not of themſelves a <hi>formed</hi> inſtituted Church, but muſt therefore be added to the Gentile-Churches, <hi>i. e. Congregations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore theſe perſonal <hi>qualifications,</hi> are not ſo <hi>fitted</hi> to the <hi>definition</hi> of the viſible Church, as <hi>communion</hi> in the Ordinances of God; for <hi>whereſoever this is fixed</hi> and ſettled, there is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a <hi>true viſible Church,</hi> this communion ſuppoſeth the <hi>called,</hi> beleevers, profeſſors on the one ſide, and the <hi>officers</hi> or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of the Ordinances on the other ſide, and plainly expreſſeth or ſignifieth to us, the <hi>eſſence</hi> or <hi>truth</hi> of the viſible Church, by the <hi>formal actions</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Now, that I may yet, be more <hi>free</hi> from <hi>exception,</hi> and more <hi>truely</hi> underſtood, I ſhall here recollect, and ſubjoyne what hath beene already in a <hi>ſcattered</hi> way hinted, about
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:118938:63"/> theſe two great conſiderable in a few brief <hi>conceſſions</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. I grant, that theſe perſonal <hi>qualifications</hi> are <hi>neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> ſuppoſed in this communion in Ordinances, in the ſenſes before given of them; the perſons thus communicating, are ſuch as are <hi>called</hi> thereunto; ſuch as profeſſe the faith therein, and ſuch as are preſumed to <hi>beleeve</hi> what they thus profeſſe, or at leaſt not to deny or <hi>renounce</hi> it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. Theſe <hi>qualifications</hi> are therefore <hi>neceſſary conditions</hi> of <hi>Church members,</hi> or of ſuch particular perſons as <hi>aſſemble</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the Church in this worſhip of God, or as <hi>Ames</hi> moſt <note place="margin">Med. p. 163</note> accurately, <hi>forma vocatorum,</hi> the forme of the <hi>called,</hi> not of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. Therefore theſe <hi>qualifications</hi> are rather to be reduced to the <hi>matter</hi> of the Church, then to the <hi>forme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. I grant, therefore, that they fitly ſerve to expreſſe the qualification of the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in the <hi>definition</hi> thereof, as I conceive <hi>Ameſius</hi> and others mean, whoſe <hi>definitions</hi> of the viſible Church, are uſually begun thus; a <hi>company</hi> of <hi>beleevers, &amp;c.</hi> or of the <hi>called, &amp;c.</hi> or of ſuch as <hi>profeſs</hi> the faith, or the true <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. Yet, I humbly conceive, the maine <hi>diſtinguſhing</hi> part of the <hi>definition</hi> of the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, lieth in the <hi>communion of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> for the <hi>reaſons above</hi> ſpecified; <hi>this,</hi> being, as was ſaid, the <hi>formal action</hi> of it, immediately ſpringing from its <hi>forme</hi> and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>viz. ſociety</hi> or community which is the <hi>next</hi> great <hi>particular</hi> in the <hi>definition</hi> of the Church and now <hi>at hand</hi> to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Onely, by the way, let <hi>this</hi> be <hi>concluded with the eaſie</hi> notice that my deſigne is yet going on; ſeeing none can doubt, but if perſons <hi>void of ſaving grace,</hi> may be <hi>truely conſidered</hi> to have <hi>faith, calling,</hi> and <hi>profeſſion,</hi> as before, they may much eaſier alſo be conſidered to partake of the <hi>outward communion</hi> of the Church, in the worſhip and Ordinances of God; and therefore, ſo far, none can hinder the <hi>definition</hi> of the Church to be <hi>applicable</hi> therunto without <hi>respect to ſaving grace.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. Would we view all the <hi>three ſpecial</hi> particulars, that lay claime to this definition, at once I humbly conceive. 1. That the <hi>qualifications</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> faith, <hi>calling, &amp;c.</hi> taken with <hi>Ames</hi> in a <hi>ſaving</hi> ſenſe, they beſt ſerve to define the Church <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible.</hi> 2. <hi>Communion</hi> in Ordinances beſt ſerve to define the <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal viſible.</hi> 3. And this <hi>community</hi> or proper ſociety beſt ſerves to define the <hi>particular inſtituted viſible</hi> Church, which is the Church which we finde moſt frequently defined by <hi>Authors;</hi> not but that they may <hi>all</hi> have their place in the definition of the particular Church, but I think thus they may all have the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> and moſt neceſſary <hi>place</hi> in the definition of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prop.</hi> 6. We then may hence note <hi>three degrees of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> in theſe three <hi>great parts</hi> of the definition of the Church.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Church <hi>cannot</hi> be without the <hi>qualifications</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, yet they may be, where the <hi>Church (viz.</hi> a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Neque tamen ſufficit, ſubitanea aliqua conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio, &amp; ſanctae communionis exercitium ad eccleſiam conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuendam; niſi etiam conſtantia illa accedat quoad intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ſaltem, &amp;c.</hi> Am. Med, p. 170</note> inſtituted Church) is not, <hi>viz.</hi> in the called or beleevers ſcattered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Actual communion</hi> conſtantly attended on, cannot be where the <hi>Church</hi> is not, yet the <hi>Church may</hi> be where there is no <hi>actual communion;</hi> the Church <hi>is</hi> really, when it doth not <hi>meet</hi> or aſſemble together; this is more neceſſary then the formes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Communion</hi> or ſociety referring to this <hi>communion,</hi> can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be where the <hi>Church</hi> is not, neither can the Church be where
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:118938:65"/> 
                  <hi>this</hi> is not; therefore, this is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> even with the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of neceſſity, for a right <hi>defining</hi> a particular viſible Church which further appeareth thus.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Definitions</hi> are fitteſt to be taken from hence, becauſe the qualifications mentioned are <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> in the perſons of this <hi>ſociety</hi> and this community doth <hi>eſſentially con-note</hi> the <hi>communion</hi> in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, in the <hi>habit</hi> or firſt act of it; when the <hi>ſecond act,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual communion is unavoidably ſuſpended, by intrinſick or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick <hi>neceſſity</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

And <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> 'tis the unity of the Church which lieth broad in the ſociety and community of all the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Some againe, that define the Church do not <hi>expreſſe</hi> it <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> in Ordinances; ſo Mr. <hi>Hudſon,</hi> the viſible Church, ſaith he, is a company of people called or ſeparated by God from Idols to the true Religion, and yeelding profeſſed ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to that call; and more plainly <hi>Wollebius,</hi> the viſible Church is a <hi>company</hi> of perſons commonly called, as well Elect as reprobate.</p>
               <p>But no Authour that I have yet met withal, did ever define the Church, without ſpecifying and expreſſing this ſociety or community one way or other. <hi>Apollonius</hi> begins his definition with <hi>ſocietas,</hi> the <hi>Leiden</hi> Profeſſors with <hi>coetus:</hi> So, <hi>Wallebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Trelcatius, Ames,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> with <hi>unitas;</hi> of Engliſh men, <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> ſaith the Churches of Chriſt are holy <hi>aſſemblies: Dayrel</hi> ſaith a particular viſible Church is a <hi>company, &amp;c.</hi> ſo

               <p>Therefore it is likely that the <hi>unity</hi> or ſociety of the Church, deſerveth the firſt and the higheſt place in the <hi>definition</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, therefore I ſhall conclude my ſelfe in thoſe expreſſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fideles non conſtituunt ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larem, quamvis ſimul plures in codem loco con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniant aut vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, niſi ſpeciali vinculo inter ſe conjugantur.</hi> Med. p. 169. <hi>Vinculum hoc eſt foedus &amp;c.</hi> Ibid.</note> words of <hi>Ameſius;</hi> that neither the faithful, or <hi>many</hi> faithful, or many faithful meeting together, or living in one place, do thereby conſtitute a particular Church, without they be further joyned together by ſome ſpecial bond among themſelvs; and I ſhall not fear to adde, with him, that this bond is a <hi>Covenant;</hi> and that this covenant ought to be ſuch, as he there defineth it, <hi>viz.</hi> that whereby the faithful oblige themſelves particularly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all thoſe duties both towards God, and mutually towards each other, <hi>which reſpect the Condition and Edification of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet give me leave to explain my ſelf in a few particulars touching <hi>this bond</hi> or Covenant, and I ſhall haſten to the concluſion of this laſt particular.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I grant, this <hi>bond</hi> or covenant may be lawfully expreſſed, at the firſt <hi>conſtitution</hi> of a particular Church, becauſe it rationally agreeth with the nature of ſuch a ſociety.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I further grant that the expreſſe <hi>bond,</hi> being a <hi>prudential</hi> thing, may be ſo much the neerer to <hi>neceſſity,</hi> by how much the more <hi>prudence</hi> dictates it, to be of uſe, and diſcovers more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent occaſion thereof <hi>accidentally</hi> occurring at the conſtitution of <hi>ſuch</hi> a Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet I muſt interpoſe againſt the <hi>neceſſity</hi> thereof in its own nature, becauſe we finde not any ſuch <hi>command</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch <hi>practice</hi> in the <hi>primitive</hi> Churches.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Neither may the <hi>want,</hi> much leſſe the <hi>abſence</hi> thereof, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny means, be hence interpreted, to the queſtioning of the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>ſuch Churches,</hi> as have the Word and Sacraments <hi>purely,</hi> or but <hi>truly</hi> adminiſtred, and conſtantly attended upon; for who can deny but that theſe are <hi>infallible</hi> marks, yea <hi>eſſential</hi> notes of a true Church? beſides, it is apparent even thereby that there is an <hi>implicit bond</hi> or covenant, wherein to ſuch a people, are not onely taken with God, but, <hi>mutuo inter ſe,</hi> mutually with one another (ſeeing as the prophet queries, how can <hi>two walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:118938:66"/> unleſſe they be agreed;)</hi> which two of the moſt eminent, <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hooker.</hi>
                  </note> as well as <hi>moderate, Congregational</hi> men, have under their hands ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, to be <hi>all</hi> that's <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the <hi>truth</hi> of a viſible Church in this reſpect.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Therefore, we muſt, <hi>with them</hi> conclude, that the form con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not in a Covenant, as <hi>expreſſed;</hi> for then where that was wanting, the Church could not exiſt; but <hi>as a Covenant</hi> or mutual bond, <hi>ſo far as it is neceſſarily ſuppoſed in the nature of ſuch a ſociety,</hi> or community.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Although I have before granted, that either an <hi>expreſſe</hi> or <hi>implicite</hi> covenanting to performe the duties of Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, is a <hi>neceſſary duty,</hi> binding all that are admitted into ſuch a <hi>relation;</hi> Yet I muſt ſtill deny it to be of ſuch abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, as that the <hi>non-real</hi> and <hi>actual</hi> intention in a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo to covenant and <hi>oblige</hi> himſelfe ſhould exclude the <hi>reality</hi> of his <hi>viſible</hi> Church-memberſhip; provided, his <hi>deſire</hi> to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, be <hi>real</hi> and ſincere.</p>
               <p>The <hi>reality</hi> of his <hi>deſire</hi> of admiſſion, is eſſential to his very <hi>admiſſion;</hi> but the reality of his <hi>actual purpoſe</hi> to performe all the <hi>duties,</hi> to which he is obliged by his admiſſion, is onely eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to his ſafe admiſſion; the <hi>firſt</hi> is neceſſary for his <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> the <hi>laſt</hi> for his <hi>well-being</hi> in this ſtate of the Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip.</p>
               <p>Indeed, he is <hi>paſſively</hi> bound by the <hi>command</hi> of God, as alſo by his relation to this <hi>ſociety</hi> of the Church, both <hi>actively</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Perſons may be paſſively bound when they do not actively binde themſelves.</note> and <hi>actually,</hi> to oblige himſelf unto the ſaid duties: yet, if by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Churches <hi>careleſneſſe,</hi> he is not put upon it; or by reaſon of his <hi>ignorance</hi> of <hi>this</hi> his duty, or his <hi>unwillingneſſe</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, at preſent, ſo farre in it; he ſhall not thus <hi>oblige</hi> himſelf, he is not thereby preſently <hi>diſobliged</hi> from his duty, by the <hi>nullity</hi> of this his <hi>Relation,</hi> or viſible Church member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This actual obliging himſelf in truth, to performe all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <note place="margin">There is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary duty, &amp; a neceſſary condition.</note> of a Church-member, is, therefore a <hi>neceſſary duty,</hi> accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his admiſſion, but no neceſſary condition thereof, or without which he cannot be admitted.</p>
               <p>And <hi>this,</hi> I would conceive to be the meaning of <hi>Ames</hi> his words before noted, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>bond, without which,</hi> the faithful do not <hi>conſtitute</hi> a particular Church, is a <hi>Covenant, vel expreſſum,</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:118938:67"/> 
                  <hi>vel implicitum;</hi> which <hi>implicitum,</hi> I humbly conceive, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily <note place="margin">An implicit Covenant op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and an actual cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting.

We covenant conſequentially or vertually what neither expreſſely nor actually.</note> be oppoſed both to <hi>expreſſum</hi> and to <hi>actuale;</hi> and his meaning is, or ſhould be, that neither an <hi>expreſſe,</hi> that is, a <hi>vocal;</hi> nor yet an <hi>actual,</hi> whether <hi>vocal</hi> or <hi>mental Covenant,</hi> is a <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo</hi> neceſſary, as without which the <hi>faithful</hi> cannot <hi>conſtitute</hi> a Church; but a <hi>conjunction</hi> ſo far <hi>foederata,</hi> as his <hi>phraſe</hi> is, as is <hi>neceſſary to communion,</hi> which doth <hi>implicitely, i. e. conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,</hi> though not <hi>expreſſely</hi> and <hi>vertually,</hi> though not <hi>actually,</hi> alſo bind the <hi>faithful, i. e.</hi> all the members of the Church, <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatim,</hi> to the performance of all thoſe duties, which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſo holy a <hi>ſociety</hi> calls them unto.</p>
               <p>For, I readily grant, that, though particular perſons do not <hi>actually,</hi> either in their words or <hi>thoughts,</hi> oblige themſelves ſo <hi>largely;</hi> yet, by their very <hi>deſire</hi> of <hi>admiſſion</hi> into the Church, if admitted, they do by <hi>conſequence</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> thereof, oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto all <hi>thoſe</hi> duties that the <hi>ſtate,</hi> into which they deſire to be, and are accordingly admitted, doth <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <note place="margin">We binde our ſelves vertually to more, when we yeeld to be admitted, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; then we that are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted think of or intend.</note> put them upon; ſo, in concluſion this <hi>foedus,</hi> as it is extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Ames</hi> his deſcription, is neceſſary, in <hi>intentione paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis,</hi> viz. admiſſion, <hi>non patientis,</hi> the perſon admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>8. Yet at length, we muſt <hi>conclude,</hi> that there is very little <hi>uſe</hi> of, and conſequently, as little reaſon to diſpute about <hi>this bond,</hi> whether expreſſe or implicite, in conſtituted Churches; ſeeing, <hi>herein,</hi> our <hi>members</hi> are generally admitted in their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy;</hi> and what ſhall need to be impoſed at years of <hi>diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> cannot, with any ſhew of reaſon intend their <hi>admiſſion</hi> into the Church; it being rightly, either but in order to their <hi>admiſſion</hi> to ſome higher Ordinance; or, at moſt their <hi>confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in that <hi>ſtate,</hi> and thoſe priviledges, whereinto they are indeed admitted, before, in baptiſm; but of this more <hi>directly,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more <hi>largely</hi> hereafter.</p>
               <p>However, my maine <hi>concluſion</hi> paſſeth ſtill; for if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are ſubjects of <hi>both</hi> this <hi>ſociety,</hi> and the <hi>bond</hi> thereof, may be conſidered (as before is proved <hi>without reſpect</hi> to ſaving grace; then, doubtleſſe, ſo may <hi>both</hi> the <hi>ſociety</hi> and the bond thereof, touching the <hi>firſt, viz.</hi> the ſociety, there is no colour of doubting; and touching the <hi>latter, viz.</hi> the Covenant, let <hi>Amens</hi> himſelf, <hi>whoſe</hi> words haply are the ground of our doubt,

               <p>As a <hi>man</hi> doth not loſe any part of his <hi>eſſence,</hi> or ceaſe at all to be a <hi>man,</hi> when he ceaſeth the <hi>exerciſe of his reaſon,</hi> in his <hi>ſleep,</hi> or the like; becauſe, the <hi>eſſence</hi> of his <hi>manhood</hi> lieth not in the <hi>exerciſe,</hi> but in the <hi>faculty</hi> of reaſon; whereby he is fitted, and duely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to <hi>exerciſe</hi> the ſame, when <hi>occaſion</hi> is offered, and <hi>impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are removed; So the <hi>Church</hi> ceaſeth, not to be a Church, when ſhe ceaſeth her <hi>actual communion</hi> in the worſhip of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the Church, being in ſociety to that end, doth not <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> it, though indeed it ſtrongly intend it, and <hi>diſpoſe</hi> unto it, as it conteineth a habit therof, or at leaſt an <hi>obligation</hi> thereunto, upon due ſeaſons.</p>
               <p>Yet, though the <hi>communion</hi> be not <hi>actual,</hi> but onely habitual; we may not ſay the <hi>community</hi> is onely <hi>habitual</hi> and not <hi>actual;</hi> it would be ſtrange to ſay, that a <hi>man</hi> is only an <hi>habitual</hi> man, becauſe his reaſoning is <hi>now habitual,</hi> and not actual, or a <hi>ſociety</hi> of ſuch a <hi>trade</hi> is onely <hi>habitually</hi> ſo, when it doth not <hi>actually meet</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble together.

               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:118938:70"/>
               <p> Therefore, to have put <hi>ordinary or orderly meeting together,</hi> into the <hi>definition</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> would have made the definition <hi>larger</hi> then the <hi>definitum</hi> ſometimes; ſo that <hi>ſometimes</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> muſt have been no Church, when indeed it is ſo; or the <hi>definition</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, muſt have been no <hi>proper</hi> definition thereof, but <hi>variable,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fit, and ſometimes not; <hi>fit</hi> when the Church is an <hi>actual meeting,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> fit, when ſhe hath <hi>adjourned</hi> to another time.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>this</hi> definition <hi>[a ſociety called out of the world to the worſhip of the true God]</hi> being <hi>fit</hi> to expreſſe the <hi>nature,</hi> both of the <hi>univerſal</hi> and the <hi>particular</hi> viſible Church, and that at all <hi>times</hi> and <hi>ſtates</hi> thereof, it may, I think be yeelded, to be a <hi>proper definition thereof.</hi>

               <p>Now to <hi>draw</hi> up this diſcourſe, I ſhall onely further intimate, that the <hi>definition</hi> of the viſible Church, may be <hi>truely conſidered</hi> to be ſuch, and truely applicable to the viſible Church, <hi>without</hi> any <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſaving grace,</hi> as appears to the very firſt <hi>glance</hi> of our <hi>obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> from the <hi>definition fix'd upon, viz.</hi> that it is a <hi>ſociety of men called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2.

               <p>BEfore we paſſe on to that <hi>way</hi> of arguing, termed <hi>inartificial</hi> namely from <hi>authority;</hi> we think fit to conſider a few <hi>obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> which may be called artificial, and leave the other Objections which ariſe from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to be handled (I think more methodically) after my <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments thence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt, and indeed the <hi>onely conſiderable</hi> objection againſt me is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 'Tis confeſt, that there is but <hi>one true</hi> Church; 'tis alſo confeſt, that the <hi>inviſible</hi> Church is <hi>one true</hi> Church; but now, the Church <hi>inviſible</hi> cannot be conſidered <hi>to be truely ſuch without reſpect to ſaving grace;</hi> therefore, neither the Church <hi>viſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, that in <hi>general</hi> this argument is juſtly <hi>exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible</hi> againſt; becauſe, before it reacheth the <hi>concluſion</hi> of my <hi>opponent,</hi> it evidently concludeth <hi>that,</hi> which I preſume, <hi>himſelf</hi> renounceth, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>viſible Church is in no reſpect at all;</hi> either with, or without <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, to be <hi>truely</hi> a Church of Chriſt; that this is the <hi>firſt</hi> concluſion of the argument is moſt <hi>obvious,</hi> from the two firſt propoſitions. 1. 'Tis ſaid there is but one true. 2. The <hi>inviſible,</hi> is <hi>one</hi> true Church. What now doth <hi>force</hi> it ſelf from hence, but therefore the <hi>viſible is no viſible Church;</hi> ſomewhat a <hi>ſtrange</hi> concluſion, unknown, I think to all the <hi>ages</hi> of the Church before us; and <hi>ſuch</hi> as impoſed upon the <hi>providence</hi> of God, to have entruſted this <hi>whole worſhip</hi> and Ordinances in the hands of a <hi>falſe</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>2. Hereby alſo we have a quick <hi>diſpatch</hi> of the preſent <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie;</hi> for, what need we reach any further after the thing
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:118938:71"/> before us, <hi>viz.</hi> whether <hi>the viſible Church</hi> may be conſidered to be truely a Church of Chriſt, <hi>without this reſpect to ſaving grace,</hi> if it be firſt concluded, that there is <hi>no viſible Church at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. But, <hi>more directly,</hi> I anſwer, by denying at leaſt one of theſe things; either, 1. That the <hi>one true Church</hi> is the Church <hi>invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</hi> Or, 2. That though the <hi>one true</hi> Church be inviſible, yea, and this <hi>inviſible</hi> Church cannot be conſidered to be <hi>truely ſuch without</hi> reſpect to <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, yet it followeth not that the <hi>viſible</hi> Church may not be conſidered to be <hi>truely a Church of</hi> Chriſt <hi>without</hi> reſpect to <hi>ſaving</hi> grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I might deny (with fairneſſe enough) that the <hi>one true</hi> Church, is <hi>properly</hi> the Church <hi>inviſible,</hi> until my <hi>arguments</hi> above, for the <hi>contrary</hi> are anſwered; till <hi>when,</hi> the <hi>preſent</hi> objection, can <hi>challenge</hi> no anſwer.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:118938:71"/> (ſeeing it is therefore ſaid to be <hi>inviſible,</hi> becauſe of its ſaving grace, and the <hi>ſubjects</hi> thereof, cannot be <hi>ſeen</hi> or <hi>certainly</hi> known by men) yet, <hi>this</hi> Church, in its <hi>viſible</hi> conſideration, or as it is the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, may be conſidered to be <hi>truely ſuch, without</hi> reſpect to <hi>ſaving</hi> grace; <hi>(ſeeing, that</hi> which renders it thus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible hath no <hi>neceſſary</hi> dependance upon <hi>ſaving</hi> grace) as Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend <hi>Hudſon</hi> ſaith well, the Church is conſidered to be <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>inviſible, à duplici modo communionis, externae &amp; internae; viſible,</hi> with reſpect to its <hi>external</hi> way of communion, which doth <hi>not ſuppoſe ſaving</hi> grace; and <hi>inviſible,</hi> with regard to its <hi>internal</hi> way of communion, which <hi>doth</hi> ſuppoſe <hi>ſaving</hi> grace.</p>

               <p>Now, I humbly offer, whether the <hi>reformed</hi> Divines, aſſerting the <hi>inviſible</hi> Church to be the <hi>onely true Church,</hi> can poſſibly be though to exclude the <hi>viſible</hi> Church from being <hi>true</hi> in the firſt branch of this diviſion. <hi>viz.</hi> in that <hi>natural</hi> ſenſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a thing is ſaid to have the <hi>truth of being and exiſtence;</hi> why

                  <hi>real cauſes?</hi> why do they tell us of the <hi>marks</hi> of the <hi>true</hi> viſible Church? why do <hi>none</hi> of them aſſert that the <hi>viſible</hi> is not truely a Church, or that the <hi>inviſible</hi> Church, is <hi>alone,</hi> the Church truely ſo called? yea, in that they aſſert it to be <hi>viſible,</hi> they conclude it to be <hi>real,</hi> ſeeing we cannot ſee that that is <hi>not.</hi>

               <p>To <hi>apply</hi> it, when theſe Divines affirme, that the <hi>inviſible Church is the onely true Church,</hi> can they be underſtood in any <hi>other</hi> ſenſe then this, <hi>viz.</hi> that they onely are the true Church in this cloſe ſtrict and <hi>ſaving</hi> ſenſe, as the Church is taken <hi>ſtrictly?</hi> and is it not as evident, as any thing in the world, that they intend only to ſhut hypocrites out of the Church in this <hi>strict</hi> and ſaving ſenſe? and as plaine, that they allow them a <hi>place</hi> in the Church, as it is largely taken, which large acceptation of the Church is

               </p>

                  <hi>Bullinger</hi> frames an <hi>objection</hi> on purpoſe that he may have an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to declare his minde to this point; his objection is, <hi>How can hypocrites, being members of Satan, be members of the Church?</hi> He anſwers, by diſtinguiſhing of <hi>hypocrites.</hi> Some, ſaith he, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in their own righteouſneſſe, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did; <hi>theſe</hi> are <hi>not;</hi> others do not ſo, but neither hating, nor flying from, nor perſecuting the Church, do outwardly joyne with it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the ſame faith a while with it, &amp;c. theſe are <hi>members</hi> of the Church <hi>till</hi> they fall away; and much more thoſe that <hi>continue</hi> in this profeſſion till they die; which he largely proves (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed moſt of the <hi>reformed</hi> Divines do) from all the <hi>parables</hi> of <note place="margin">

               <p>Yet, this doth not infer <hi>two diſtinct</hi> Churches, for if we take the Church <hi>ſtrictly,</hi> then <hi>hypocrites</hi> are no part of the Church; and if we take it in the <hi>large</hi> ſenſe, then the <hi>ſtrict</hi> Church is but a part thereof, to inſtance in the <hi>material</hi> Church, if taken in a ſtrict ſenſe, it ſignifieth the body of the Church excluſive of the <hi>chancel,</hi> if largely, for both together; and then, the Church <hi>ſtrictly</hi> taken is but <hi>part</hi> of the Church <hi>largely taken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is clear, while we diſtinguiſh the Church, <hi>qua</hi> Church, but when we conſider it as <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>inviſible,</hi> it faileth us. We ſay well, that the Church taken ſtrictly is part of the Church ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken largely, and the Church largely taken containeth the Church ſtrictly taken, but it would be hard to ſay, the Church invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible taken ſtrictly is part of the Church viſible taken largely, to ſay a thing, as inviſible is part of a thing as <hi>viſible,</hi> is <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictio in adjectio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis evident then, that inviſible and viſible are oppoſed here in the accident, not in the ſubject, <hi>i. e.</hi> 'tis not meant that as ſome perſons are inviſible, ſo others in the ſame reſpect are viſible, as if ſaving grace was not ſeen in ſome, and yet ſeen in others; but thus ſome perſons having ſaving grace not ſeen, are ſaid to be inviſible, and others having profeſſion viſible, are ſaid to be viſible.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, the Church <hi>largely</hi> taken, may be conſidered Either <hi>Aſolutely.</hi> Or Comparatively.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. I confeſſe that <hi>Ravanellus</hi> and <hi>Calvine</hi> (with <hi>others</hi> haply) affirme, that the Church, thus <hi>largely</hi> taken, is the Church <hi>improperly,</hi> and the Church <hi>strictly</hi> for the Church of the <hi>Elect</hi> onely, is the Church <hi>properly</hi> taken.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I humbly conceive, that their difference with the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> did not exact their aſſertion from them, for the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> denieth the <hi>inviſible</hi> Church altogether, and not, that it is the Church properly, or improperly taken; then this remaineth as a <hi>lawful</hi> controverſie among us <hi>Proteſtants, whether the viſible or inviſible Church be moſt properly the Church of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Neither, do I think, <hi>this</hi> aſſertion of theirs doth <hi>neceſſarily</hi> flowe from this <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>large</hi> acceptation of the Church; the larger acceptation of a thing, doth not alwayes imply the moſt <hi>proper</hi> acceptation thereof, nor <hi>è contrà,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>3.

               </p>
               <p>Yet, I ſhall adde one Argument <hi>ad hominem</hi> to prove that <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi> partake of the <hi>eſſential</hi> forme of the Church; a <hi>mark</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>eſſential,</hi> becauſe, 1. It flows directly and <hi>neceſſarily</hi> from the <hi>eſſence.</hi> And, 2. It is a ſure <hi>indication</hi> of the <hi>eſſence</hi> of a thing; therefore, whereſoever we finde an <hi>eſſential mark,</hi> there the eſſence of the thing is, and there we may <hi>know</hi> it to be; now, what is the <hi>eſſential mark</hi> of the <hi>Church?</hi> hath not <hi>Ames</hi> anſwered, the <hi>profeſſion of the true faith?</hi> therefore <hi>hypocrites, &amp;c.</hi> who, doubtleſſe, do partake of this <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> which himſelf acknowledgeth to be the <hi>eſſential note</hi> of the Church, are and may be known to be of the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the Church. <hi>Ames</hi> tells us, that hypocrites have a ſhare in the the <hi>outward</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Church, which he ſaith is the <hi>accidental</hi> forme, and which, he alſo ſaith, is the <hi>eſſential note</hi> of the <hi>true</hi> Church; therefore, they, <hi>partaking</hi> in the <hi>accidental</hi> ſtate, or <hi>forme</hi> of the Church, <hi>they</hi> alſo partake in the <hi>eſſential note</hi> of the Church, and therefore of the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the Church, and therefore of the <hi>eſſential form</hi> of the Church.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:118938:75"/>
               <p> 3. I confeſſe it is my preſent opinion, that that which <hi>Ames</hi> aſſignes to be the <hi>eſſential</hi> or internal forme, <hi>viz. faith</hi> is no <hi>forme</hi> at all, either of the Church <hi>viſible</hi> or <hi>inviſible;</hi> but onely a <hi>neceſſary qualification</hi> of the <hi>matter</hi> of the Church of the <hi>ſaved,</hi> or the Church <hi>inviſible;</hi> which ſeemes not much incongruous to <hi>Ames</hi> himſelf, ſometimes for he affirmeth that <hi>fides</hi> taken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributively is but <hi>forma vocatorum,</hi> the <hi>forme</hi> of the <hi>called,</hi> and not of the <hi>Church;</hi> and that <hi>collective</hi> ſenſe, that he would put on <hi>faith,</hi> to make it the <hi>forme</hi> of the Church, is it ſelf as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from <hi>faith,</hi> the <hi>forme</hi> of the Church, which is not far from his own meaning, yea, and words too, in <hi>another place, eccleſia maximè conſiſtit in coetu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Yea, further, I yet judge, that the <hi>viſible</hi> Church hath no <hi>internal</hi> forme at all, and that which <hi>Ames</hi> calleth the <hi>accidental</hi> forme, and <hi>others</hi> the <hi>external,</hi> is very neere unto all the <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> forme, <hi>conſtituting of the viſible Church;</hi> the viſible Church is a collective or aggregative body, and that viſible. Now whether is the eſſential form of a <hi>viſible aggregative</hi> body <hi>inward</hi> or <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?</hi> indeed, the particular parts of ſuch a body ſeparately conſidered, have their <hi>internal</hi> formes, but is not the form of the whole another thing? is not union, or rather unity or ſociety of the parts, the forme of the whole? and is not this <hi>external?</hi> for inſtance every particular ſheep hath its <hi>forme internal,</hi> but as theſe are a <hi>flock,</hi> they have another outward forme, which yet is not accidental, but eſſential to it, as it is a flock, <hi>viz.</hi> their being in unity or community or ſociety together.</p>
               <p>Indeed, 'tis neceſſary that there be ſheep, if there be a flock of ſheep, and 'tis neceſſary that theſe ſheep have their eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, which is an <hi>internal</hi> forme; yet both theſe are but conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a congruous matter which is eſſential to every <hi>compoſitum.</hi> I grant therefore, that ſheep with their internal forme are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the flock, <hi>viz.</hi> as the matter is eſſential, but they are no part of the forme.</p>
               <p>I grant alſo, that in <hi>rational aggregative</hi> bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men; there lieth ſome difference from a heap of inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate creatures, as ſtones, &amp;c. &amp; from a flock of ſenſitive creatures, as ſheep, &amp;c. becauſe the reaſon of man doth qualifie rational ſocieties, with an habitude or aptitude to various ends and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, which are accordingly diſtinguiſhing and ſpecifically
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:118938:75"/> differencing rational ſocieties; and which is not <hi>communicable</hi> to other <hi>collective</hi> bodies which are <hi>irrational;</hi> therefore there is ſomething to be <hi>underſtood,</hi> at leaſt, if not expreſſed, which is to ſignifie the <hi>reaſon</hi> or the end of every rational ſociety, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from ſocieties of men, of <hi>another kinde. Ex. gr.</hi> among men there are <hi>domeſtick politick ſcholaſtick</hi> &amp; <hi>eccleſiaſtick</hi> ſocieties, which conſtitutes a <hi>family,</hi> a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> a <hi>Colledge,</hi> and a <hi>Church.</hi> Now, without ſome <hi>peculiar reaſon</hi> or end of theſe <hi>ſeveral</hi> ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, how ſhall we diſtinguiſh the one from the other? they are all <hi>collective</hi> bodies, they are ſocieties of men, yea, they may be all ſocieties of Chriſtians, yea, they may be all ſocieties of Chriſtians that are in a ſtate of <hi>ſalvation;</hi> and yet diſcovered by a <hi>general</hi> deſcription onely, and nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated to diſtinguiſh to us <hi>one kinde</hi> of ſociety from <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>ſomething</hi> is to be added, beſides a <hi>bare ſociety of Chriſtians,</hi> to diſtinguiſh the Church from a Chriſtian <hi>family,</hi> a Chriſtian <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> or a Chriſtian <hi>Colledge,</hi> which hath beene often hinted to be the <hi>peculiar</hi> reaſon and <hi>intention</hi> of this eccleſiaſtick ſociety from all others, <hi>viz.</hi> the joynt and publick <hi>communion</hi> thereof in the <hi>worſhip</hi> and Ordinances of God.</p>
               <p>Neither, may it be then replied, that the <hi>forme</hi> of the Church conſiſteth not in <hi>coetu,</hi> or in ſociety, becauſe there is ſomething to be added to <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> the ſame; for that which is added, is but the quality or reaſon of this ſociety, or its being ſuch a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, yet a <hi>ſociety</hi> ſtill; even as none may ſay, that the <hi>forme</hi> of a man is not his ſoul, becauſe a ſoul, in general, is not that which diſtinguiſheth a <hi>man</hi> from a <hi>beaſt;</hi> a <hi>beaſt</hi> being an <hi>animated</hi> creature as well as a man, without the <hi>ſpecification,</hi> or <hi>eſſential</hi> quality of <hi>reaſon</hi> added. However, indeed 'tis ſuch a ſoul that is the <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>man;</hi> not a <hi>ſoul</hi> in general, nor yet <hi>reaſon</hi> in <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract</hi> conſideration from ſoul, but the <hi>ſoul as ſuch,</hi> or the <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoul;</hi> ſo in the caſe before us, the <hi>forme</hi> of the Church lieth in a <hi>ſociety</hi> ſo <hi>qualified</hi> or intended, or <hi>as ſuch;</hi> yet ſtill a <hi>community,</hi> though as <hi>Ames</hi> ſaith, a community that <hi>looks at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the</hi> worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>Yet, laſtly, that I may not ſeem to <hi>acquieſce</hi> in my own ſenſe, and alſo that I may, if poſſible, attaine the <hi>genuine</hi> notion of

               </p>
               <p>Give me leave to explicate my meaning by the former diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, as largely and ſtrictly taken, each of which <hi>acceptation,</hi> I conceive, will bear its <hi>diſtinct definition,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently may be ſuppoſed to have its diſtinct <hi>eſſential</hi> form, ſo far, as this <hi>diverſe acceptation</hi> will hold.</p>
               <p>A heap of <hi>ſtones,</hi> wherein there are many <hi>precious</hi> ſtones, may be taken <hi>ſtrictly</hi> for a <hi>heap</hi> of <hi>precious</hi> ſtones, and <hi>largely</hi> for a heap containing <hi>both</hi> the <hi>precious</hi> and the <hi>common.</hi> Now, if <hi>this</hi> heape be <hi>defined</hi> exactly according to <hi>both</hi> theſe acceptations, who would not ſee a <hi>formal</hi> difference betwixt them? the one muſt be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of all the common, and the other muſt generally agree unto, and receive in, both the common and precious; Thus if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Church, as conſiſting onely of the <hi>Elect;</hi> and againe, if we define it as ſuch a ſociety as agreeth to both the <hi>Elect</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate;</hi> muſt not the definitions differ as much as the <hi>Elect</hi> and <hi>reprobate, i. e. ſpecifically;</hi> for in the <hi>latter</hi> the Elect and reprobate are found to agree in one <hi>common</hi> bond, or fellowſhip; which, by the <hi>former</hi> is utterly <hi>diſſolv</hi>'d.</p>
               <p>Yet, this doth not make <hi>two</hi> diſtinct <hi>Churches,</hi> farther then in our conſideration; the reaſon thereof is plaine; becauſe the Church is a ſociety made up of <hi>heterogeneous</hi> parts, or parts ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically differing in their proper natures; and this <hi>various</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation thereof, doth ſtrictly conſider and define onely one part, or largely takes the <hi>whole</hi> together; yet all the while there is no real ſeparation of theſe Churches, but the one ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>whole,</hi> and the other is but a part if largely conſidered; we may conſider the <hi>precious</hi> apart, and the <hi>common</hi> apart; and we may define it as a heap of precious ſtones, and as ſuch a heap as containeth in it ſtones both common and precious, and yet there is but one real heap, and the heap taken <hi>ſtrictly</hi> is but part of of the heap taken <hi>largely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This matter may be plainer underſtood thus; an aggregative body is ſuch, as not one thing <hi>abſolutely;</hi> but ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth <note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2.

               </head>
               <p>THat we may yet further ſearch into the minde of God in the preſent controverſie, we ſhall now deſcend to conſider the <hi>titles</hi> which all allow to be equiualent to viſible Church-memberſhip; and to what kinde of perſons the <hi>Scripture</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth them; which with the more <hi>fairneſſe</hi> and <hi>fitneſſe</hi> of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be diſpatcht in the confirmation of the following <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Word of God aſcribe ſuch titles as are truely <hi>equivalent</hi> to <hi>viſible Church-memberſhip,</hi> unto <hi>ſuch</hi> perſons, as the Word of God it ſelf hath <hi>teſtified</hi> to have, at that time, had no <hi>(evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> at leaſt of) <hi>ſaving</hi> grace; then the viſible Church, may be conſidered to be <hi>truely</hi> a Church of Chriſt without reſpect to <hi>ſaving</hi> grace.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>conſequence,</hi> I confeſſe there is one thing <hi>begg'd,</hi> which yet I think <hi>none</hi> will <hi>deny</hi> me, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>it is good arguing from the members,</hi> to the <hi>body;</hi> or the parts of the Church to the <hi>whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But conſidering that, 1. The Church <hi>(entitively</hi> taken) is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a <hi>company of members.</hi> 2. That the whole <hi>difference,</hi> in diſpute, reſteth upon the <hi>matter</hi> of the Church, and the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <hi>qualification</hi> thereof: And, 3. That chiefly, as it hath <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ſubjecti,</hi> in which ſenſe <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and all within are <hi>members</hi> of the Church. And, 4. That the <hi>end</hi> of this great controverſie, is evidently <hi>practice,</hi> which is onely converſant about <hi>particular</hi> perſons or <hi>members,</hi> my conſequence here is not to be excepted againſt.</p>
               <p>But now the Word of God aſcribeth ſuch <hi>titles</hi> as are <hi>truely</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:118938:81"/> 
                  <hi>equivalent</hi> to viſible Church-memberſhip, to ſuch particular perſons as the Word of God it ſelfe hath teſtified to have at that time, had no <hi>(evidence</hi> at leaſt of) <hi>ſaving</hi> grace.</p>
               <p>This is indeed the <hi>propoſition</hi> that the <hi>nature</hi> of this <hi>diſpute</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to to be <hi>proved;</hi> which I think I ſhall be able to do in many particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Brother</hi> is in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 8. equivalent to <hi>Church-member,</hi> yet even there it is aſcribed to ſome that give no <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>ſaving</hi> grace; <hi>ye do wrong and defraud, and that your brethren;</hi> thoſe that do wrong and <hi>defraud</hi> their <hi>brethren,</hi> give no evidence of ſaving grace, but ſome that do wrong and defraud their brethren, are even by the Scripture called <hi>brethren;</hi> for if the <hi>defrauded</hi> are <hi>brethren</hi> to the <hi>defrauders,</hi> then by the ſame reaſon of rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>defrauders</hi> are <hi>brethren</hi> to the <hi>defrauded,</hi> but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded are brethren to the defrauders <hi>your brethren;</hi> therefore the defrauders are brethren to them, as indeed they are expreſſed to be; <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>Brother</hi> goeth to Law with <hi>brother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Called,</hi> is a title in Scripture equivalent to Church-member. But our Saviour therein alſo tells us, that ſome are called that give no <hi>evidence of ſaving</hi> grace; even ſome that neither then had any ſaving grace, nor ever ſhould; for more are aſſerted by Chriſt to be <hi>called</hi> then are <hi>elected,</hi> but no more, either now have, or ever ſhall have ſaving grace, then are <hi>elected;</hi> therefore <hi>ſome</hi> are <hi>called</hi> that neither now have, nor ever ſhall have, <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, and conſequently that give no evidence thereof; but of this fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently heretofore; if it be ſaid, that they ſeemed to have ſaving grace, <hi>that's</hi> nothing; for our <hi>ſaviour</hi> ſaw, that they <hi>indeed,</hi> had <hi>none;</hi> and yet the ſame time, when he makes a diſcovery of that, he ſaith, not that they <hi>ſeeme to be,</hi> but that they <hi>are called. q. d.</hi> theſe many <hi>ſeem</hi> to be <hi>elected,</hi> but <hi>indeed ſome</hi> of them are not elected, they are onely <hi>called;</hi> for many <hi>are called, but few choſen.</hi>

                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:118938:82"/> 1.

               <p n="3">3. The title of being a <hi>childe of the Kingdome,</hi> Matth. 8. 12. given to ſuch as have no ſaving grace; for Chriſt himſelfe there aſſures us, that ſome of the children <hi>of the Kingdome,</hi> muſt go <hi>accurſed into hell;</hi> but certainly, never any that hath the leaſt degree of <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, ſhall go thus accurſed into <hi>Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Being in <hi>the field</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>barne</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>net</hi> of Chriſt is in <hi>Scripture</hi> equivalent to viſible Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; for the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of heaven is <hi>compared</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to all theſe; and to be in the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and a Church-member, are in the <hi>Scripture</hi> of <hi>equal lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, the ſame Scriptures which compare the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of heaven, or the Church of God to a <hi>field, barne, floore</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:118938:82"/> and <hi>net,</hi> do fully attribute a place in them all to ſuch as have no ſaving grace; there are tares in this <hi>field, chaffe</hi> in this <hi>barn-floore,</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> fiſh in this <hi>net</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Being in Chriſt,</hi> is doubtleſſe equivalent unto Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip. But the Scripture (and Chriſt himſelf therein) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth ſome perſons to be <hi>in him,</hi> that yet it witneſſeth at the ſame time, to have no truth of <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, <hi>John</hi> 15. 2. <hi>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit;</hi> Some <hi>branches</hi> are ſuch, as beare no <hi>fruit,</hi> but muſt be <hi>burned,</hi> as <hi>verſe</hi> 6. yet even theſe are <hi>owned</hi> by Chriſt, to be <hi>branches,</hi> and branches in <hi>himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have read a <hi>bad</hi> anſwer ſomewhere unto this, that the words <hi>[in me]</hi> are to be underſtood laſt, and that the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the words are but thus, every branch that <hi>beareth not in me;</hi> which is ſaid, not to imply the branches <hi>being in Chriſt</hi> at all, but onely to intend its <hi>bearing no fruit</hi> in Chriſt; but the <hi>very look</hi> of the <hi>text ſhames it;</hi> For, 1.

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Diſciple,</hi> in Scripture, is a title equivalent to <hi>viſible Church-member.</hi> But the Scripture doth reckon ſome to be diſciples, whom it ſelf alſo teſtifieth to have had no ſaving grace, <hi>John</hi> 6. 66. <hi>From that time many of his Diſciples went back and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more after him;</hi> now let it be ſuppoſed, that by their apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy (it being indeed total and final) they now ceaſed to be diſciples, yet this onely evidenceth for the time paſt, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any true grace, howbeit they were then diſciples, unleſs

                  <hi>The</hi> third <hi>Argument from</hi> Scripture, <hi>admitting perſons into Church-memberſhip upon account</hi> diverſe <hi>from</hi> ſaving <hi>grace; the difference of the</hi> Infant <hi>and</hi> Adult <hi>eſtate largely conſidered.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MY <hi>third</hi> and laſt <hi>Argument</hi> from the <hi>Word</hi> of God, is grounded upon the <hi>condition of admiſſion</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into the <hi>viſible</hi> Church of God, <hi>therein</hi> allow'd, and it is this.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Word</hi> of God both alloweth and requireth, that perſons be <hi>admitted</hi> members of the viſible Church, upon an account that is <hi>really diverſe</hi> from <hi>ſaving</hi> grace; therefore the viſible Church may be conſidered to be <hi>truely</hi> a Church of Chriſt without reſpect to ſaving grace.</p>
               <p>The <hi>antecedent</hi> here is not to be touch'd: for unleſſe we pretend that according to Scripture, the childe born within the Church is admitted a member thereof, for his own habitual or inherent grace, or that foederal or imputed grace is <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, or that he is not of the Church, or not to be baptized, till he make a <hi>profeſſion</hi> of <hi>ſaving</hi> grace in his own perſon (all which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently <hi>abſurd)</hi> we muſt needs yeeld, that according to <hi>Scripture</hi> perſons are admittable into the Church, upon an account that is <hi>diverſe</hi> from <hi>ſaving</hi> grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> It may not be <hi>objected,</hi> that the child is admitted upon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of his <hi>parents</hi> ſaving grace; for, as that is falſe in it ſelfe (as anon will be ſhewne) ſo it reacheth not at all to our preſent purpoſe, which onely concerneth the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>very perſon</hi> admitted, and the <hi>ground</hi> thereof in <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, I grant, that this is concludent <hi>onely</hi> in <hi>ſettled</hi> Churches; for at the firſt plantation of a Church <hi>perſonal</hi> qualities are to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:118938:85"/> be expected in <hi>Heathens adult</hi> for their admiſſion into viſible Church-memberſhip, as alſo when they are to be adjoyned to any particular Church already ſetled; and therefore ſo farre onely as concerneth the <hi>admiſſion</hi> of <hi>infants</hi> in ſetled Churches.</p>
               <p>However is not this <hi>our</hi> common caſe? yea, and of <hi>all the Churches?</hi> were not <hi>our</hi> and <hi>their</hi> members admitted in <hi>infancy,</hi> time out of minde? all ſtanding as members grown up, or <hi>branches</hi> ſprung from the <hi>old root,</hi> in the garden or <hi>Church</hi> of God? at leaſt <hi>ordinarily</hi> and for the moſt part? for how <hi>rare</hi> a thing and extraordinary is it, to hear of a <hi>Pagan, Turk</hi> or <hi>Jew</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>Chriſtian?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>conſequence</hi> is alſo evident, upon this ground, that the <hi>ſame</hi> grace may eaſily be conſidered to continue the <hi>being</hi> of the viſible Church, which firſt gave it; unleſſe ſome <hi>violent</hi> accident (as renouncing the Covenant, &amp;c.) hath ſince diſolved it; for as <hi>Dayrel</hi> ſaith well, we muſt know that all which be once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <note place="margin">page 171</note> into the Church, do remaine members of the ſame Church, be they never ſo wicked, until either they themſelves depart from it, or elſe by <hi>excommunication</hi> they be caſt out; and that conſequently all the ſcandalous perſons aforeſaid, were in and of the Church, yea, the <hi>inceſtuous perſon,</hi> till he was <hi>excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated;</hi> and this (as he addes) <hi>they of the ſeparation</hi> likewiſe acknowledge to be true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The great <hi>objection</hi> here is, that <hi>children</hi> remaine Church-members by <hi>foederal</hi> holineſſe until they come unto their <hi>adult</hi> eſtate indeed, but no longer, for then they muſt give the <hi>anſwer of a good conſcience</hi> for themſelves, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue <hi>this relation</hi> to the Church upon the account of their <hi>own faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I readily grant, that all children baptiz'd in their <hi>infancy</hi> ought, when at yeares of diſcretion, to give this anſwer of a <hi>good conſcience,</hi> both by their evidence of their knowledge of Chriſt, and an holy <hi>conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. I further grant, that there is an evident neceſſity upon all ſuch baptized perſons, to <hi>own the faith</hi> into which they are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, at leaſt, <hi>negatively;</hi> ſeeing that a <hi>poſitive</hi> renounciing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of putteth <hi>out of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:118938:86"/>
               <p> 3. Yet, admit that perſons thus baptized, in their <hi>infant</hi> ſtate, ſtate, do not give <hi>ſuch anſwer,</hi> at years of diſcretion, either of their <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>holineſſe</hi> as they ought to do, it by <hi>no meanes</hi> follows, that they are <hi>forth-with</hi> rendred out of the Church, or that their <hi>former foederal,</hi> or relative holineſſe, is hereby <hi>null;</hi> for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The <hi>Word</hi> of God (wherein alone his minde is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed) hath no where <hi>evidenced</hi> that <hi>foederal</hi> or relative holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of perſons <hi>borne</hi> in the Church, or their relation to the Church <hi>thereby,</hi> is extinct at years of <hi>diſcretion,</hi> or removed and loſt by <hi>ignorance,</hi> or the want of the evidence of <hi>ſaving grace;</hi> if but one text were produced intimating this, this part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie ends.</p>
               <p>2. Yea, indeed, the contrary is more then <hi>evident in ſacred writ, viz.</hi> that <hi>relative</hi> holineſſe doth proceed, even into the <hi>adult</hi> eſtate, and that <hi>ignorance</hi> or want of the <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>ſaving grace,</hi> doth not then extirpate our <hi>former</hi> (hurch intereſt <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd</hi> thereby, and <hi>ſealed</hi> in <hi>infancy;</hi> was not <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous perſon at their adult eſtate? or were they ſuch as <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced ſaving</hi> grace? yet <hi>Iſhmael</hi> [Gal. 4. 30.] and the <hi>inceſtnous</hi> perſon [1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12.] are both acknowledged to be within; hath it not appeared, <hi>abundantly,</hi> that perſons <hi>charged</hi> by God himſelf with <hi>actual rebellion,</hi> are alſo <hi>acknowledged</hi> at the <hi>ſame inſtant,</hi> by the <hi>ſame God,</hi> to be <hi>his people?</hi> how could they be ſo <hi>charged,</hi> had they not been at <hi>adult age?</hi> and how could they be ſo <hi>acknowledged,</hi> had they had no <hi>foederal</hi> or relative <hi>holineſſe,</hi> for they had <hi>none other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, (to put it out of <hi>further</hi> queſtion) this people are <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly</hi> ſaid to be a <hi>holy people,</hi> Deut. 14. 2. even while they were <hi>charged</hi> with being <hi>ſtiff-neck'd,</hi> and a <hi>rebellious</hi> people unto this place, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. <hi>verſe</hi> 6, 7. and what <hi>holineſſe</hi> could that be, that was conſiſtent with a <hi>ſtiffe neck,</hi> and a <hi>rebellious heart,</hi> but a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-holineſſe?</hi> even as 'tis there expounded to be; <hi>I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen thee to be my people,</hi> or a <hi>holineſſe of ſeparation;</hi> as it alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <note place="margin">Deut. 14. 2.</note> to be a <hi>peculiar people unto himſelf,</hi> above all the nations that are upon the earth.</p>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:118938:86"/> and made its application to the times of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 9.</p>

               <p> 1.

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. It is <hi>objected</hi> from <hi>John</hi> 8. 37. that thoſe that were <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> ſeed were yet the <hi>devils</hi> children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What then? therefore ſome <hi>Church-members</hi> are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> the children of the <hi>devil;</hi> but this we deny not, onely, we ſtill aſſert, that notwithſtanding they may be <hi>really</hi> members of the viſible <hi>Church,</hi> as well as <hi>really Abrahams</hi> ſeed; in regard of their holy <hi>profeſſion</hi> and <hi>ſtate,</hi> they were really Church-members and children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yea, of <hi>God;</hi> but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their unregenerate <hi>nature,</hi> and rebellious <hi>lives,</hi> they were (as our Saviour affirmes) <hi>the children of the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were there any need, we might fully explicate the <hi>anſwer</hi> hereunto, by diſtinguiſhing of the Jews. Firſt, as they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed. And, ſecondly, as they are called the <hi>Devils</hi> children.</p>
               <p>Firſt, theſe <hi>Jews</hi> may be thought to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, either <hi>carnally, eccleſiaſtically,</hi> or <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> i. e. ſavingly, as his <hi>natural</hi> off-ſpring, as <hi>Jews,</hi> or as borne of him, the <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> as holy branches of that old <hi>root</hi> or members of the Church. Or, laſtly, in that ſtrict and <hi>ſaving</hi> ſenſe, as the children of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> or the ſeed of the promiſe, <hi>elect</hi> to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:118938:89"/> 1. Now to apply, if our Saviour here mean, that theſe <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed onely in this <hi>firſt</hi> ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> borne of his naturaly body, but by their <hi>hereſie</hi> denying Chriſt, and their <hi>ſchiſme, negative,</hi> keeping themſelves off from the Goſpel-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; and <hi>poſitive,</hi> raiſing themſelves as a Church in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction and oppoſition to the <hi>Goſpel Church now</hi> planting in the world (of all which they were highly guilty,) deſervedly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced, and cut off from the Church; then I ſay, <hi>this text</hi> reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not our caſe; for, though ſuch deſperate <hi>murderers</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> of life, and open rebels againſt the <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>meanes</hi> of ſalvation, are no <hi>real</hi> Church-members; it followeth not that therefore we cannot conſider <hi>others</hi> that joyn themſelves to the Goſpel, and profeſſe to expect ſalvation from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> to be ſo neither.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If our Saviour meant that they were the viſible Church and people of God, and <hi>Abrahams ſeed</hi> in that <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-ſenſe; <note place="margin">This I take to be the common ſenſe of Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors, for though they call theſe Jews <hi>carnales Abrahae poſteras,</hi> yet they oppoſe <hi>carnales</hi> here to <hi>ſpirituales,</hi> i. e. <hi>veros</hi> in their known and common ſenſe. Vid.

Or, ſecondly, it is yeelded, that theſe Jews were not onely nominally, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally members of the viſible Church, and then my deſire is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> that perſons void of <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, as theſe Jewes were, may be conſidered to be real members of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Indeed, if we take <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, here, in the <hi>laſt</hi> ſenſe, <hi>viz. ſpiritually</hi> or ſavingly ſuch; then the oppoſition is moſt evident; for thus they could not be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and the children of the devil alſo, and our Saviour plainly ſtaves off from the firſt, by ſo ſharp a charge of the ſecond, <hi>q. d.</hi> you think becauſe you have <hi>Abraham</hi> to your father, that you are the heirs of ſalvation and heaven, but alas ye are the devils chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and muſt look for your place and portion with him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may diſtinguiſh alſo of theſe <hi>Jewes,</hi> as they
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:118938:90"/> are here affirmed to be the <hi>children of the Devil.</hi> The children of the devil are ſo in nature or habitually, or in <hi>converſation,</hi> or ſervice, or ſo in ſtate, condition, profeſſion and viſible ſhew; nor though ſuch as are in nature and ſervice the children of God, and in grace and works the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> cannot be in ſtate, profeſſion or outward ſhew the children of the Devil, yet on the contrary it is too evident in ſad experience, and plaine in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> that ſuch as are the children of God and our father <hi>Abraham,</hi> in profeſſion and condition, may yet be the children of the world, the fleſh and the devil in heart, and life, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; as theſe <hi>Jews</hi> were, who though they were ſo notoriouſly eminent in the ſervice of the <hi>devil</hi> againſt Chriſt and his Goſpel, are yet acknowledged by our Saviour here to have <hi>Abraham</hi> to their father, and by <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 9 4. to be the adopted <hi>children</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>

Again, all hypocrites that cover their rottenneſſe under ſpecious profeſſions of the truth of their grace, from the eyes of the world, have the <hi>name</hi> and ſhew of the members of the Church inviſible, or of the Church of the ſaved, when they have nothing at all of the <hi>truth</hi> or <hi>being</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>2. But 'tis moſt evident, that our Saviours words now urged, reach onely the latter ſort of theſe <hi>pretenders;</hi> and lay us a ground onely to diſtinguiſh of <hi>nominal</hi> and <hi>real</hi> members of the Church of the ſaved; ſo far is it from troubling the courſe of our queſtion at all; for if we mark, the Text ſaith not that this Church hath a <hi>name</hi> to be a <hi>Church,</hi> but to live, to have ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and ſaving <hi>life in her</hi> in oppoſition whereunto ſhe is alone ſaid to be <hi>dead.</hi> Againe, this life doth not ſeeme ſo much as to pretend the life of outward grace, or that which is the principle of the ſtate and condition of the viſible Church, but onely the life of habitual and inward grace, or that which is the principle of <hi>good works</hi> and a holy converſation, as is very evident from the very Text, <hi>I know thy works,</hi> thy works are not <hi>perfect before God,</hi> v. 1, 2.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> One great help for the right underſtanding of this Text is to weigh the <hi>conditions</hi> of theſe perſons here ſpoken of; the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the immediate verſe foregoing, telleth us that they were <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> that is, deſperate hereticks, for <hi>ut Chriſtus ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um aluit tulitque proditorem, ſic etiam Apoſtolis alendi erant multi Antichriſti &amp; Pſeudo Apoſtoli,</hi> as <hi>Marlorat</hi> hath collected out of <hi>Thomas Naogeorgius,</hi> of whom <hi>Bullinger</hi> out of <hi>Tertullian, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naus,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> giveth us a particular account in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary upon this Text; they were (ſaith he) <hi>Simon Magus, Menander, Saturninus, Baſilides, Carpocrates, Cerinthus, Haebion,</hi> the two firſt of them were by their <hi>proſelytes worſhipped</hi> as God, the reſt denied, either the Divine or the Humane nature of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And now the queſtion would be, whether theſe perſons were guilty of thoſe groſſe and Antichriſtian Hereſies, while they continued to be <hi>ex Apoſtolorum ſocietate,</hi> as <hi>Marlorate</hi> ſpeaks, or under the pretext and <hi>profeſſion</hi> of Chriſtian <hi>Religion?</hi> thoſe words of <hi>Naogeorge</hi> on the place, <hi>ſubdolos</hi> and <hi>falſos fratres</hi> ſeem to carry the affirmative; as alſo, what <hi>Bullinger</hi> addeth of them, <hi>cum Chriſtianorum nomine ſe vinditarint Haeretici, &amp;c.</hi> Now if ſo, the matter is ended, for I have before acknowledged, that ſuch, as upon any treacherous or corrupt deſigne take up and carry the profeſſion of religion not hiſtorically owning, but with a ſecret purpoſe of minde rejecting the faith and doctrine of Chriſt, are onely doubtleſſe (to uſe <hi>Brentius</hi> his words) <hi>Chriſtianorum numero, nomine &amp; titulo; rever à nunquam credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derunt.</hi>

               <p>2.

               <p> Now, firſt, I <hi>yeeld</hi> that this phraſe is not to be <hi>reſtrained</hi> to the ſociety of the Apoſtles, but to be enlarged to the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>faithful,</hi> or thoſe <hi>primitive Apoſtolical Churches,</hi> from which they truely broke themſelves off, as well as from the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But if we would indeed diſcerne the <hi>clear</hi> and diſtinct opinion of the <hi>Church</hi> in this <hi>famous</hi> controverſie, we need not be ſo much buſied in drawing <hi>conſequences,</hi> or offering <hi>ſnatches</hi> from what ſhe hath <hi>ſcattered</hi> by her worthy <hi>hands,</hi> up and down, upon <hi>other</hi> occaſions; but rather ſeriouſly to fix and ponder upon what ſhe hath delivered about it, when <hi>called</hi> by ſome <hi>eminent</hi> and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al providence to ſpeak <hi>punctually</hi> to it.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>this controverting</hi> age of ours, there have been three remarkable <hi>periods</hi> of ſpecial occaſion, exacting the <hi>ſentence</hi> and judgement of the Church in the preſent caſe; upon <hi>all</hi> which we now proceed, briefly to examine what <hi>judgement</hi> ſhe hath made.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> eminent occaſion hereof was urged by the <hi>Donatiſts;</hi>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:118938:94"/> the firſt great ſtickler in it; who held, that <hi>none but the godly were true members of the viſible Church;</hi> the very point, I humbly conceive, that we have all this while been arguing againſt; but was this indeed the opinion of the <hi>Donatiſts?</hi> if St. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> may be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, doubtleſſe it was, <hi>illud oſtendere tentaverunt (inquit</hi> Auguſt.) <hi>Donatiſtae prolatis multis testimoniis Divinarum Scripturarum,</hi>

                  <hi>quod eccleſia Dei non cum Malorum hominum commixtione futura praedicta ſit;</hi> though driven by diſpute, at length they evaded, by limitting their opinion to <hi>openly wicked,</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi> teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alſo, <hi>Malos in eccleſia permixtos eſſe confeſſi ſunt Donatiſtae, ſed occultos eos eſſe dixerunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this worthy <hi>mouth</hi> and champion of the Church in his age hath noted <hi>this</hi> opinion as an errour, and therefore not his <hi>own opinion,</hi> and as an errour of <hi>this ſect</hi> of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and therefore not the opinion of the <hi>true Catholick Church</hi> of God in his time, as abundantly appears by his ſet and purpoſed large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, in moſt of his <hi>volumes</hi> againſt the errors of the Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical <note place="margin">

               <p>And leaſt it ſhould be thought that the heat of <hi>dispute</hi> ſhould have tranſported him, he giveth us his <hi>judgement,</hi> moſt clearly and fully upon other occaſions about it; as before we noted (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dr. <hi>Fulk) Augustine</hi> teacheth us, that ſuch as ſhall certainly fall away, and that finally and conſequently, ſuch as have no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace, according to <hi>their preſent ſtate</hi> (that is while they abide with the Church) they are <hi>truely members thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again in the ſame place upon thoſe known words of the Apoſtle, <hi>they were not of us;</hi> that is, ſaith he, they were not of the number of the ſons, even when they were of the <hi>faith</hi> of the ſons (what he means by ſonſhip here, he telleth us in his <hi>reaſon</hi> in the next words) becauſe, they that are the ſonnes <hi>indeed</hi> are <hi>foreknown</hi> and <note place="margin">

               <p>THe third more ſpecial occaſion, exacting the judgement of the <hi>Church</hi> herein, was given by the <hi>Browniſts;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we ſhall briefly note two things to ſerve us in our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. 1. That it was the opinion of the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> that the eſſence of the viſible Church, conſiſted in ſaving grace, contrary to what I am labouring to prove. 2. That this was judged an errour, and a great part of the errour of <hi>Browniſme,</hi> as ſuch, by the eminent patrons of our Church and truth in that generation, going onely before, as in the preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this was the opinion of the <hi>Browniſts</hi> indeed, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the viſible Church carrieth in it ſaving grace; moſt plentifully appears, by their aſſerting, owning, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ſame in all their <hi>writings,</hi> witneſſe <hi>Smith, Barrow, Ainſworth, Robinſon, Johnſon</hi> and <hi>Cann, &amp;c,</hi> who tell us <note place="margin">Defence of the churches. p. 17 their Apol. p. 44 counterpoiſon p. 115. and 200 <hi>Barrows</hi> true deſcription of the viſible church. p. 2 Principles and infer. p. 8. &amp; 10</note> that the Church is a ſeparated company of <hi>righteous</hi> men from the open <hi>wicked</hi> men of the world, and that it cannot conſiſt of all ſorts good and bad, in which no unclean thing or perſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth, that keepeth the unity of faith in the bond of peace, and love unſeigned; that is a company of <hi>faithful people</hi> that true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhip Chriſt, and readily obey him, a company of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, a viſible communion of Saints, that is ſuch as are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from <hi>all known ſinne;</hi> practiſing the <hi>whole will of God known;</hi> growing in grace and knowledge and continuing to the <hi>end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And more fully and accurately let <hi>Smith</hi> be heard once more in the name of the reſt; the true forme of a true viſible Church (ſaith he) is partly <hi>inward,</hi> and partly <hi>outward;</hi> the <hi>inward</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Princ. &amp; inf. p. 11</note> part of the <hi>forme</hi> conſiſteth in three things. 1. The <hi>Spirit.</hi> 2. <hi>Faith.</hi> 3. <hi>Love.</hi> The Spirit is the ſoul animating the whole <hi>body; faith</hi> uniteth the <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> to the <hi>head,</hi> Chriſt
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:118938:96"/> Jeſus; love uniteth the <hi>members</hi> of the body each to other; the <hi>outward</hi> part thereof is a <hi>vow, promiſe, oath,</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> betwixt <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Now that this was held the <hi>errour</hi> of the <hi>Browniſt,</hi> and a part of their <hi>Browniſme,</hi> and that it was not the allowed opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the true Church, eſpecially in <hi>England,</hi> appeares abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly in the diſputations of all our <hi>Divines</hi> againſt them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we find theſe <hi>two propoſitions</hi> irrefragably proved. 1. That an <hi>Aſſembly</hi> may be a true viſible Church, though its worſhip be very <hi>corrupt.</hi> 2. That perſons may be members of the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, by profeſſing the <hi>true</hi> Religion, though without ſincere grace or holy life; the latter of which is directly for us; and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence whereof, <hi>Dayrel</hi> ſo ſmartly replied to Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> you ſpeak (ſaith he) you know not what, for herby you imply a true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <note place="margin">Dayr. p. 36, 37</note> Church is a company of people profeſſing and practicing ſuch things as will bring them to <hi>ſalvation.</hi> Whereupon it follows that there is no hypocrite in the viſible Church; for whoſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is anſwerable to his holy <hi>profeſſion,</hi> he is no <hi>hypocrite;</hi> nor <hi>reprobate,</hi> or any that ſhall be damned; and thus you unawares confound the <hi>viſible</hi> and the <hi>inviſible</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Johnſon</hi> himſelf teſtifieth thus much on our behalf, even while he <note place="margin">His defence of the churches and Miniſtry of <hi>England.</hi> p. 71.</note> ſaieth his accuſation againſt us; the forward <hi>preachers</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (as he pleaſeth to call them) teach (ſaith he) that the true viſible Church of Chriſt is not a <hi>ſeparated company of righteous men</hi> from the open wicked of the world, but may conſiſt of people <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>THere is a <hi>twofold diſtinction</hi> by ſome made uſe of, to <hi>evade</hi> or weaken the <hi>authority</hi> aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is urged that ſome eminent <hi>Divines</hi> aſſert, that <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi> are onely <hi>equivocè,</hi> and not <hi>verè</hi> of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>But hereunto we need only remember what hath formerly been (I think truely) obſerved, that ſuch Divines underſtand, by <hi>Church</hi> in the propoſition, the <hi>Church of the ſaved,</hi> which they themſelves uſually called the Church <hi>Catholick,</hi> or the Church invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and none can doubt but ſuch Church-memberſhip is <hi>predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable</hi> of <hi>hypocrite,</hi> onely, <hi>nominally,</hi> or equivocally and not <hi>really.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">When <hi>Willet</hi> had let fall that expreſſion, that wicked men are in, but not of the Church, he preſently corrected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, adding, yea they (wicked men) may be members of the viſible church for a time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>contro.</hi> of the church. p 62</note> Church, but not <hi>of</hi> the Church <hi>inviſible,</hi> as the number of the ſaved.</p>
               <p>Or, as before we received from <hi>Doctor Field.</hi> We are to take them as intending onely, when they ſay that wicked men are not of the Church, that they are not of <hi>the Church ſo fully,</hi> effectually and ſavingly, as the <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>elect</hi> are, not but that they are ſo really.</p>
               <p>Therefore there is plaine <hi>Scripture</hi> ground to diſtinguiſh of being <hi>of the Church,</hi> viz. <hi>ſavingly,</hi> as they that fell away (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 12.) <hi>were not.</hi> 2.

               </p>
               <p>But to ſilence all poſſible <hi>objections,</hi> I ſhall now undertake to conclude from ſeveral principles, undoubtedly owned by <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Churches</hi> in all ages, that they have ever denied ſaving grace to be eſſential to viſible Church-memberſhip, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, muſt needs have ever held that wicked perſons may be <hi>of the</hi> viſible <hi>Church,</hi> and that <hi>really,</hi> and not <hi>equivocally</hi> onely, if it be oppoſed to really.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. To believe that relative holineſſe is really ſufficient <note place="margin">

Am. p. 168, 169</note> to intereſt in viſible Church-memberſhip, is to believe alſo, that <hi>ſaving</hi> grace doth <hi>not onely</hi> do ſo, unleſſe <hi>relative</hi> holineſſe and <hi>ſaving</hi> grace be all one, a <hi>Paradox</hi> that no Proteſtant aſſerts; but the Church hath ever beleeved that relative holineſſe giveth <hi>real</hi> intereſt to <hi>viſible</hi> Church-memberſhip.</p>
               <p>For firſt, ſhe never doubted but that children borne within the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, were really in Covenant and Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Nor, ſecondly, that their <hi>title</hi> thereto is founded, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>perſonal,</hi> much leſſe <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, but upon <hi>parental</hi> or <hi>relative</hi> holineſſe.</p>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The <hi>conſtant</hi> unſcrupled <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>baptizing</hi> the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of all ſuch, as remaine within the <hi>pale</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> can truely proceed from no other <hi>principle</hi> but this, <hi>viz.</hi> that Church-memberſhip may be really conſidered without reſpect to <hi>ſaving</hi> grace; this is demonſtrated by two conſiderations. 1. That it was never the practice of any Church, conſtantly and ordinarily <hi>(i. e.</hi> without the <hi>Adoption</hi> of ſuch children unto <hi>Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents)</hi> to baptize the <hi>children</hi> of <hi>Pagans,</hi> or of ſuch as are no <hi>Church members.</hi> 2 That it cannot be imagined by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are ſerious in the caſe, that all that are within the pale of the Church make <hi>evidence</hi> ſatisfactory of <hi>ſaving</hi>

               <p>But now it cannot be denied me that ſuch hath been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant unſcrupled practice of the Churches of Chriſt in all ages, <hi>viz.</hi> to baptize the children of all ſuch as lived within the pale of the Church.</p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>Calvine</hi> writes againſt the <hi>baptizing</hi> of the children of the <hi>Papists.</hi> But, 1. <hi>Papiſts</hi> live not within the pale of our
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:118938:98"/> (reformed) Church. 2. And his reaſon given againſt it, is not becauſe the Papiſts have no grace, or becauſe they are hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites; but becauſe they want ſound <hi>doctrine</hi> and are judged <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Yet, 3. The eccleſiaſtical <hi>Colledge</hi> of <hi>Geneva</hi> plainly <note place="margin">Againſt <hi>Knox</hi> p. 88</note> tell us, that whereſoever the profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> hath not utterly periſhed, and been extinct, <hi>Infants</hi> are beguiled of their <hi>right,</hi> if the <hi>common</hi> ſeale be denied them.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe that <hi>Ameſius, Hilderſham,</hi> (and ſome others haply) would have us put a difference in ſealing the children of the <hi>wicked (i. e.)</hi> ſuch as do <hi>apertè</hi> in the face of the world, <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Covenant.</hi> But, 1. They never queſtioned the right of <note place="margin">

Nor denied the actual admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration thereof unto ſuch, <hi>wholly,</hi> onely in prudence urged the great uſe of <hi>Sponſores, viz.</hi> godly perſons to undertake for children in ſuch a caſe. 3. This reacheth not our caſe, for the reaſon hereof was not becauſe they had no ſaving grace, but becauſe their open wickedneſſe was a preſent blot and ſcandal to <hi>Religion,</hi> for which they ought by this ſuſpending the ſeale from their children, to be made aſhamed and brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. 4. However this is but the judgement of particular men, and contrary to the judgment and practice of the Churches in general, as our preſent <hi>argument</hi> extends it ſelf; yea, howſoever our Congregational brethren have of late taken up the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Maſter <hi>Rutherford</hi> hath noted that <hi>Beſt,</hi> a famous <hi>Browniſt,</hi> denied baptiſme to belong to the children of the excommunicate onely; which yet he doubtleſſe did not becauſe ſuch were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have no <hi>grace,</hi> but becauſe they were, by the ſentence of excommunication, <hi>caſt out of the Churches;</hi> clearly yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the children of all Church-members are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
               <p>Yea, though our Congregational brethren are yet ſo <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> as to allow our Churches to be true Churches, and yet ſo <hi>ſevere</hi> to deny our <hi>Infants</hi> the firſt <hi>ſeal;</hi> we ſuppoſe this is not, becauſe they judge us all to be void of ſaving grace, or out of the general Covenant of God, but (as Maſter <hi>Cotton,</hi> Maſter <hi>Norton, &amp;c.</hi> affirme) becauſe we are not within their <hi>eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical particular</hi> Covenant, and that in their practice, in their own Congregations they are more <hi>favourable</hi> to the <hi>Infants</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:118938:98"/> borne therein, and their <hi>application</hi> of the <hi>ſeals</hi> is as <hi>large</hi> as their <hi>Church</hi> and Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Thoſe that in their conſtant courſe of preaching, ſtill ſuppoſed that men might violate their <hi>Covenant</hi> with God, cannot but be thought to hold that men may be <hi>truely</hi> in Covenant with God, and conſequently in the <hi>Church</hi> without <hi>ſaving</hi> grace; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially conſidering. 1. That if men do <hi>break</hi> Covenant with God, it is by great and notorious <hi>wickedneſſe.</hi> 2. That to <hi>men,</hi> who are <hi>now</hi> the <hi>Judges,</hi> ſuch as are guilty of <hi>notorious</hi> wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and do, as <hi>Ames</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Aperte violari foedus Dei,</hi> give no evidence of <hi>ſaving</hi> grace; and <hi>laſtly,</hi> that as it was before obſerved, men cannot break that <hi>bond</hi> they are not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> or violate that <hi>Covenant, in which</hi> they cannot be ſaid <hi>to be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, none can have the leaſt ground of doubting, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch hath not been the conſtant courſe of <hi>proaching,</hi> yea, and <hi>writing</hi> too, by the whole <hi>cloud</hi> of the <hi>men of God</hi> in all ages that hath the leaſt <hi>communion</hi> or <hi>converſe</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Thoſe that hold that <hi>notoriouſly ſcandalous</hi> perſons are within, until they be cenſured and <hi>caſt out,</hi> muſt needs be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hold alſo, that perſons <hi>void</hi> of <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, may be real members of the viſible Church, that is <hi>de facto,</hi> if not <hi>de jure;</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe one that appeareth <hi>notoriouſly ſcandalous,</hi> appears thereby to have no ſincere or <hi>ſaving grace;</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule <hi>eſſe &amp; apparere ſunt equipollentia in jure,</hi> ſeeing <hi>men,</hi> who judge onely according to appearance, are <hi>Judges</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>But now it hath been the univerſal opinion or judgement ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all the Church in all ages, that <hi>notoriouſly</hi> wicked and ſcandalous perſons are really within, untill they are cenſured and caſt out, as <hi>Willet</hi> ſaith, cloſe infidels are in the viſible Church <hi>de jure,</hi> and openly wicked and flagitious perſons are ſo <hi>de facto,</hi> until excommunicated, both of which do indeed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently argue that <hi>ſaving</hi> grace is not an <hi>eſſential</hi> requiſite to <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> Church-memberſhip, neither can it be imagined, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they are granted to be within, that they are capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>caſt out,</hi> or unleſſe they be granted to be <hi>really</hi> within, that they can <hi>really</hi> be caſt out; therefore perſons (as <hi>Ames</hi> aptly <note place="margin">Medal. p. 201</note>

               <p>It will but little availe to urge here, that ſome Divines af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme <hi>wicked men</hi> and <hi>hypocrites,</hi> to be onely in, and not of the Church, for the ſame <hi>Divines</hi> acknowledge the moſt <hi>notoriouſly</hi> wicked, ſo far in the Church as to be liable to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. The <hi>practice</hi> of the Church-hath ever been to <hi>readmit</hi> the <hi>penitents</hi> (that is ſuch as after <hi>baptiſme</hi> have been <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate</hi> for ſcandal, and have given <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to the Church <hi>againe)</hi> into Church-communion, without <hi>rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read indeed of one kinde of Anabaptiſme in the ancient <note place="margin">

                  </note> was afterwards both condemned by a better adviſed counſel, and alſo revoked by the chiefeſt authours thereof them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>re-admitting penitents</hi> without <hi>re-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi> them, doth evidently argue this principle whereſoever it
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:118938:99"/> is found that perſons may be conſidered in relation to the viſible Church without reſpect to ſaving grace. For, 1. Theſe peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents were acknowledged to have had ſome ſecret union with the Church, even by the Church her ſelf in their moſt <hi>ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous condition,</hi> when the Church could have no evidence at all of their <hi>ſaving</hi> grace otherwiſe, upon their <hi>repentance</hi> they had <hi>entred</hi> covenant, and conſequently muſt have had the <hi>initiating ſeal</hi> applied, <hi>viz.</hi> baptiſme; for what reaſon can there poſſibly be given why, <hi>elſe,</hi> they could not be <hi>re-baptized;</hi> but onely this, becauſe they were held, never <hi>wholly extirpated</hi> out of the Church or Covenant, by <hi>ſcandal</hi> or <hi>cenſure?</hi> neither can it be imagined, that their now repenting is a certaine evidence of <hi>ſaving</hi> grace to have been in their hearts, in the midſt of their <hi>wickedneſſe;</hi> and therefore conclude we muſt that they held that ſomething elſe beſides ſaving grace did <hi>root</hi> and intereſt in viſible Church-memberſhip; for if <hi>being in Covenant,</hi> and conſequently being in the Church, did <hi>appear</hi> unto the Churches where ſaving grace did not appeare, who ſeeth not this conſequence that the Churches judged, that <hi>intereſt</hi> in the Church and Covenant is not <hi>founded</hi> in <hi>ſaving</hi> grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. The Church hath ever held that <hi>vera fides,</hi> and <hi>ſana doctrina,</hi> is an <hi>eſſential note</hi> of the <hi>true</hi> viſible, with <hi>Ames;</hi> thereupon our reformed <hi>Divines</hi> aſſert that a <hi>doctrinal,</hi> and not a perſonal ſucceſſion, is a <hi>neceſſary mark</hi> thereof, and according to reverend <hi>Hilderſham, profeſſion,</hi> and <hi>preaching</hi> of true doctrine <note place="margin">

               <p>Hence it muſt needs follow, that the Church ever held, that the eſſence of the viſible Church, doth not neceſſarily require ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace. For, 1. The <hi>eſſential</hi> property or <hi>note</hi> of any thing, doth immediately <hi>connote</hi> or argue the <hi>eſſence</hi> or forme of that thing. 2. The profeſſion of the true doctrine of Chriſt, doth not <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> much leſſe <hi>immediately, connote</hi> or argue <hi>ſaving</hi>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. Laſtly, to put the matter yet further out of doubt; thoſe very <hi>Divines</hi> that are ſuſpected in the point, do generally aſſert, that the viſible Church conſiſteth of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi> that <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi> are <hi>de jure</hi> of the viſible Church, that they are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted members of the Church, till they <hi>wholly</hi> renounce the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> that they are in the external part of the Covenant; that they are in the Church according to the external ſtate thereof, that they have a viſible right to the Ordinances, all which are moſt obvious as well to the ſlighteſt, as ſeriouſeſt reader, and ſearcher of the reformed writings; and the leaſt of which will <hi>fully</hi> ſatisfie my deſigne.</p>

                  <hi>The laſt Argument from the</hi> oppoſite <hi>to my</hi> poſition, <hi>and the dongerous</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences <hi>thereof.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WE have hitherto argued, from the <hi>name,</hi> the <hi>cauſes,</hi> and the <hi>definition</hi> of the viſible Church, as alſo from divine and humane <hi>authority;</hi> one <hi>place</hi> of argument more (we hope) may ſerve to <hi>conclude</hi> the queſtion.</p>
               <p>Which (let me ſay without <hi>offence)</hi> is the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>conſequences</hi> that neceſſarily attend the <hi>contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> aſſertion, or the groſſe abſurdities that <hi>certainly</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it.</p>
               <p>My Argument <hi>hence</hi> ſupports it ſelfe upon <hi>three</hi> poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:118938:100"/>
               <p> 1. <hi>Contradictories cannot be both falſe;</hi> which to affirm would directly imply an evident <hi>contradiction,</hi> viz. as if it ſhould be ſaid, <hi>this</hi> neither is a man, nor <hi>not</hi> a man; ſo that if it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that <hi>this</hi> aſſertion, that <hi>ſaving grace</hi> is of the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the viſible Church, or viſible Church-memberſhip, is indeed <hi>falſe,</hi> then the <hi>contradictory</hi> hereunto that ſaving grace is not of the eſſence of the viſible Church, or viſible Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip muſt needs be true.</p>
               <p>2. Againe, <hi>what is truely found in the concluſion may be justly laid upon the premiſes,</hi> that infer that concluſion; whereupon 'tis taken for <hi>abſurd,</hi> to <hi>deny the concluſion;</hi> but the fault muſt be ſought for in the <hi>premiſes;</hi> therefore, if that which <hi>naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth</hi> the aſſertion contradictory to ours be <hi>abſurd</hi> and naught, the <hi>aſſertion</hi> it ſelf, which is the ground and cauſe thereof cannot be ſound or good.</p>
               <p>3. But now the <hi>conſequences of this, that ſaving grace is of the eſſence of the viſible Church,</hi> which is the formal <hi>contradiction</hi> to my concluſion, may eaſily <hi>appear</hi> to be ſomewhat <hi>abſurd,</hi> by theſe few that follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abſurd.</hi> 1. Then no <hi>reprobate</hi> did ever partake of the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the viſible Church, or was <hi>indeed a member</hi> thereof, and <hi>Judas</hi> was either no <hi>Church-member</hi> or no <hi>reprobate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abſurd.</hi> 2. Then there are no <hi>hypocrites</hi> in the viſible Church, and either the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were no <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> or no <hi>children</hi> of the <hi>[viſible] Kingdome</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abſurd.</hi> 3. Yea then, indeed there are no <hi>hypocrites at all;</hi> for if there were none <hi>within</hi> the Church, there can be none <hi>without;</hi> ſeeing it is <hi>neceſſarily</hi> ſuppoſed, that a <hi>hypocrite</hi> be a <hi>profeſſor</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and there are none that profeſſe <hi>Religion without</hi> the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abſurd.</hi> 4. Then the election of God is as large as his <hi>calling;</hi> and either thoſe <hi>many,</hi> whom our Saviour affirms to be <hi>called,</hi> were not called; or elſe, though our <hi>Saviour</hi> intimates that they were <hi>not,</hi> yet they <hi>were elected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abſurd.</hi> 5. Then, moſt of thoſe that <hi>conſtantly</hi> attend upon all the parts of Gods <hi>publick worſhip,</hi> are yet, not of the viſible Church, but indeed <hi>Heathens;</hi> ſeeing <hi>Heathen</hi> is put in oppoſition to <hi>viſible Church-member</hi> in the Word of God.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:118938:101"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Abſurd.</hi> 6. Then that great and weighty <hi>obligation,</hi> preſſing <hi>wicked Church-members to reformation</hi> in Scripture from their <hi>relation</hi> to God, their being <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his <hi>children</hi> his <hi>people, &amp;c</hi> is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>evacuate,</hi> and made of no force at all; for there are none ſuch, but even to think of a <hi>wicked Church-member,</hi> implieth a <hi>contradiction in adjecto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abſurd.</hi> 7. Then the ſtrong obligation upon wicked Church-members to <hi>gratitude</hi> and thankfulneſſe, for the <hi>bounty</hi> and <hi>favor</hi> of God in all the <hi>priviledges,</hi> and advantages, and Ordinances of the Church to <hi>them</hi> and <hi>theirs,</hi> is made <hi>invalid</hi> and weakned to nothing; for <hi>God</hi> it ſeemeth never vouchſafeth any <hi>ſuch things</hi> unto them, but they daily ſteale and rob <hi>God of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abſurb.</hi> 8. Then that ſore <hi>aggravation</hi> of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>puniſhment,</hi> which God in the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath provided from the former <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> for the <hi>rebellious</hi> children of his <hi>Kingdome</hi> againſt the <hi>day of judgement,</hi> is wholly prevented; for it ſeemes ſuch being no real Church-members or Subjects of Gods Kingdome, and the <hi>duties</hi> of ſuch, and their mercies not duely or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> belonging unto them, the <hi>aggravations</hi> taken againſt them <hi>thence</hi> are <hi>ill grounded,</hi> and conſequently of no <hi>weight,</hi> force, or <hi>juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abſurd.</hi> 9. Thus, the <hi>viſible Church</hi> is confounded with the <hi>inviſible,</hi> or is not at all <hi>diſtinct</hi> therefrom; for if the <hi>Elect</hi> be the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, and <hi>ſaving vocation</hi> its <hi>forme,</hi> as is pretended, and <hi>thoſe</hi> be alſo the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>forme</hi> of the <hi>Church inviſible,</hi> wherein lies the <hi>difference?</hi> or indeed, who ſeeth not a wide <hi>difference</hi> betwixt this opinion and our <hi>Saviours do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine (many are called, &amp;c.)</hi> and its perfect agreement with <hi>Browniſme</hi> of late and <hi>Donatiſme</hi> of <hi>old;</hi> together with its <hi>strangeneſſe</hi> to the writings of all the <hi>reformed</hi> Divines, who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally <hi>allow</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> the <hi>distinction</hi> of the Church into <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> and <hi>inviſible,</hi> and judge <hi>that</hi> Church, <hi>truely</hi> a Church, which is more <hi>largely</hi> taken, or taken largely in its <hi>diſtinction</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> more <hi>ſtrictly</hi> taken, or the Church of the <hi>ſaved,</hi> or <hi>called</hi> according to the <hi>election;</hi> and conſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntly reckon that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal calling</hi> (and not <hi>ſaving)</hi> is the <hi>forme</hi> of the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, or the Church <hi>largely taken,</hi> which they conclude to be <hi>complexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam malos quam bonos.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:118938:101"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Abſurd.</hi> 10. This opinion, that <hi>ſaving</hi> grace is of the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, draweth many <hi>abſurdities</hi> with it, touching the diſpenſation both of <hi>cenſures</hi> and <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, touching <hi>cenſures,</hi> if no wicked man be a <hi>real</hi> member of the viſible Church, it inevitably followeth, either, that pertinacious <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> doth <hi>formally excommunicate,</hi> and that every ſuch wicked perſon doth formally excommunicate himſelf, ſeeing he cannot be denied to be the <hi>formal agent</hi> of his own <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe;</hi> or, at leaſt that there is no need of <hi>ſuch a cenſure</hi> of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, to put wicked perſons out <hi>of the Church,</hi> ſeeing, that for which a man deſerveth thus to be <hi>caſt out,</hi> or cut off, is open <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi> and that hath (if not put him out. yet) declared him to be <hi>without,</hi> or no Church-member before.</p>
               <p>2. Yea, indeed, we may juſtly inferre, that there is no ſuch thing as <hi>caſting out of the Church</hi> at all; For, 1. Thoſe alone are to be caſt out that are <hi>(obſtinately) wicked.</hi> But, 2. Obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked perſons were never within (that is <hi>quoad homines)</hi> for, if <hi>intereſt</hi> in the Church be <hi>founded</hi> in <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, and none ever <hi>fell away</hi> from <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, then none ever fell away from their <hi>intereſt</hi> in the <hi>Church;</hi> and conſequently, thoſe that have no evidence of <hi>ſaving</hi> grace (as the obſtinately wicked have not) they appeare to <hi>men</hi> never to have been <hi>within,</hi> and therefore not <hi>caſt out</hi> at all, but onely, as <hi>ſome</hi> pleaſe to ſpeake, <hi>declared</hi> to have been ever <hi>ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Then it <hi>further</hi> follows, that there is no poſſibility for the <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>judge</hi> thoſe that are within; for obſtinately wicked perſons are <hi>alone</hi> to be <hi>judged;</hi> now <hi>theſe,</hi> if they have no ſaving grace are (it ſeemes) not <hi>within;</hi> and that they have any ſaving grace, cannot be <hi>diſcerned</hi> while they remaine <hi>obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately</hi> ſcandalous, and when they ceaſe to be obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> they ceaſe to be <hi>objects</hi> of the cenſure of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Yea then, the Church hath no poſſibility left her of <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any;</hi> for ſhe hath power to <hi>judge</hi> none, but ſuch as are <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> and ſuch as are <hi>within,</hi> that is, ſuch as have <hi>ſaving</hi> grace; neither can ſhe judge, who have <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, and who <hi>not,</hi> but by their <hi>freedome</hi> from, or appearance of <hi>ſcandal,</hi> and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:118938:102"/> conſequently, none can poſſibly be <hi>both ſcandalous</hi> and <hi>within,</hi> in the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I mean <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>poſſibility</hi> as is <hi>limited</hi> by the <hi>rule, (id poſſumus quod jure poſſumus)</hi> for, if the Church ſhould judge <hi>de facto,</hi> ſhe muſt do <hi>wrong;</hi> if ſhe judge ſuch as are <hi>not ſcandalous,</hi> ſhe erreth, becauſe ſuch deſerve it not; if ſhe judge ſuch as are ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, ſhe erreth alſo, becauſe hereby ſhe judgeth them to be <hi>within,</hi> who have no <hi>evidence</hi> (under their notorious <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal)</hi> of their being <hi>within,</hi> but indeed ſtrong <hi>evidence</hi> to the <hi>Contrary.</hi> If ſhe judge ſuch as are not ſcandalous, ſhe really wrongs the <hi>party;</hi> if ſhe judge thoſe that are ſcandalous ſhe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly wrongs a <hi>higher Judge,</hi> who hath pleaſed to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> to his own <hi>prerogative,</hi> to <hi>judge them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. This <hi>Doctrine</hi> involveth our <hi>intereſt</hi> in, and <hi>diſpenſation</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> alſo in inextricable <hi>difficulties</hi> and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is thus involved; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have their <hi>right</hi> unto it, either in themſelves or in their <hi>parents,</hi> that is, either from their own <hi>perſonal holineſſe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The contrary tenet, <hi>viz.</hi> that no profeſſor can be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace, will draw unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difficulties with it, and give ſuch advantages to the enemies of Gods grace and the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of his Ordinances that they will hardly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained, laying a corner-ſtone to build up the wretched do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hook. ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey.</hi> p. 37, 38.</note> or from their <hi>parents</hi> holineſſe, <hi>derived</hi> unto them by <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if the <hi>firſt</hi> be ſaid, it will <hi>follow</hi> from this doctrine. 1. That we are to baptize them onely upon <hi>evidence</hi> of their <hi>ſaving faith.</hi> 2. <hi>This</hi> being impoſſible, we ſhould ever diſcover, before years of <hi>diſcretion,</hi> it follows that we cannot <hi>regularly</hi> baptize an <hi>Infant.</hi> 3. Yea, no childe can then in his <hi>infancy</hi> be known to be a <hi>diſciple,</hi> to <hi>belong to Chriſt,</hi> to be a <hi>Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> to be <hi>borne to God,</hi> &amp;c. all which are not ſo much obſcured by <hi>Anabaptiſme,</hi> as clear'd by <hi>Scripture.</hi> 4. Or at leaſt the childe being baptiſed in its <hi>infancy</hi> upon charitable hopes, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by a wicked and <hi>lewd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>converſation,</hi> it appeare to the Church to have had no ſaving grace at the time of its <hi>baptiſme;</hi> it clearly followeth that upon the diſcovery of its <hi>after conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> it ought to be <hi>rebaptized;</hi> for if none but ſuch as are ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converted, enter into <hi>Covenant,</hi> then none but <hi>ſuch</hi> as are ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converted ought to be <hi>ſealed</hi> in Covenant and a ſeal ſet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Covenant is of no <hi>effect;</hi> and every one that <hi>enters</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ought to have the <hi>ſeale</hi> of <hi>initiation</hi> affixed to it. 5. Nay, grace
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:118938:102"/> I ſee not but according to the tenour of this doctrine, that ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as a man may fall by ſcandal from the evidence of his ſaving grace, (and conſequently thereby declare to the <hi>eye</hi> of the Church that he was never really within the Covenant, or the Church) and giveth penitential ſatisfaction for the ſame, whereby (in the judgement of the Church) he entreth Covenant, even <hi>ſo oft</hi> he muſt be <hi>re-baptized,</hi> though it be <hi>ſeventy times ſeven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Againe, if the childes right to <hi>baptiſme depend</hi> upon the <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, or holineſſe of the <hi>parent;</hi> then, <hi>ſuch</hi> as is the <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of the <hi>parents</hi> ſaving grace, ſuch is the evidence of the <hi>childes being lawfully</hi> and effectually <hi>baptized;</hi> ſo that, Secondly, if the parent <hi>apoſtatize</hi> to hereſie, blaſphemy, or any other kind of <hi>notorious</hi> profaneneſſe, or if the parent never had any <hi>evidence</hi> at all, of <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, ſo farre as men may <hi>charitably</hi> judge, which is all the <hi>rule</hi> the <hi>caſe</hi> and the preſent <hi>opinion</hi> will admit, the <hi>childes baptiſme</hi> is forthwith <hi>null</hi> Then, Thirdly, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth but that <hi>ſuch</hi> children, when at yeares of diſcretion, muſt give their own conſent in <hi>perſon,</hi> and be re-baptized, or elſe depend in an <hi>Heatheniſh ſtate</hi> of waiting for their <hi>parents</hi> returne, to be <hi>re-baptized</hi> with them. But, Fourthly, I cannot ſee how any one, that ſtands baptized upon his <hi>parents</hi> account, can ever be fully perſwaded that he is truely baptized, becauſe he cannot be certaine of his <hi>parents Election</hi> or ſaving vocation; ſo that the whole generation of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> who ſtand in their baptiſme, by their <hi>foederal bolineſſe,</hi> are hereby neceſſarily left in doubt, whether they be <hi>Chriſtians</hi> or <hi>Heathens.</hi> And, laſtly, is not this a faire ſtep and <hi>temptation</hi> to <hi>Anabaptiſme?</hi> yea, truely, it puts us upon a neceſſity of it; for, unleſſe all our <hi>Anceſtours,</hi> ſince the firſt entrance of our <hi>ſtock</hi> into Chriſtianity, have beene really godly at the very time of their childes baptiſme (a thing incredible) our own baptiſme is unavoidably <hi>nul;</hi> for where the reaſon and ground of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is wanting, <hi>there Baptiſme</hi> is inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid; but, according to this doctrine, where ſaving grace is wanting in the <hi>parent,</hi> the <hi>reaſon</hi> and ground of Baptiſm is wanting; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whenſoever any of our <hi>Anceſtors</hi> were baptiz'd in the time of their parents unregeneracy, then that perſons baptiſme was no baptiſme, but a <hi>ſeal</hi> ſet to a <hi>blanck.</hi> Again, the childe of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever hath no <hi>next right</hi> to baptiſme, unleſſe the <hi>parent</hi> be alſo a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:118938:103"/> 
                  <hi>baptized-beleever;</hi> therefore though the <hi>next</hi> in the line of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion unto <hi>him,</hi> that through want of ſaving grace; firſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his <hi>childs ſealing</hi> invalid, were truely a Saint, yet he was not a baptized Saint, and conſequently could not <hi>entitle</hi> his <hi>childe</hi> to baptiſme, much leſſe can this childe (unbaptized) entitle the <hi>next,</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> the <hi>next, until</hi> we deſcend to our own <hi>caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Again, our intereſt in the Sacrament of the <hi>Supper;</hi> is alike obſcure and intricate by the <hi>just conſequences</hi> of this doctrine; For, 1. Unleſſe I am well ſatisfied of <hi>two</hi> things, whereof one is very <hi>difficult,</hi> and the <hi>other impoſſible) viz.</hi> my <hi>own</hi> and my <hi>parents ſincerity,</hi> I may not venture to receive <hi>this</hi> Sacrament. I muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of my <hi>parents</hi> ſincerity, otherwiſe I cannot know my ſelfe <hi>really baptized,</hi> and conſequently I cannot know my <hi>remote</hi> right, (for one that is not <hi>really baptized</hi> hath no right to the <hi>Supper</hi> of the Lord) and then I muſt be ſatisfied of my <hi>own</hi> ſincerity, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I cannot know my <hi>next right</hi> to the <hi>Supper</hi> (or indeed my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>lawfully, i. e.</hi> really, <hi>baptized,</hi> either) and muſt with all <hi>doubting</hi> Chriſtians, be deterred therefrom, though the <hi>Scripture</hi> aſſures us to the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>if we judge our ſelves,</hi> if we finde our <hi>ſins,</hi> though we cannot find our <hi>graces,</hi> if we <hi>judg</hi> (not <hi>juſtifie</hi> or <hi>acquit)</hi> our ſelves, we <hi>ſhall not be judged</hi> (as unworthy receivers) <hi>of the Lord,</hi> as thoſe were, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 30, 31, 32.</p>
               <p>2. This muſt needs involve the <hi>Adminiſtrator</hi> alſo in hazards, doubtings, and even <hi>neceſſity of ſinning;</hi> which I rather commend to the conſideration of my Reader in the words of Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> then my <hi>own,</hi> and with which I ſhall conclude what hath been but <hi>rudely</hi> delivered upon this <hi>queſtion,</hi> that the <hi>end</hi> may <hi>crown</hi> the <hi>work,</hi> his words are theſe, then <hi>no Miniſter can ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly adminiſter the</hi> Sacraments <hi>to any man but to himſelf, becauſe he can be</hi> certaine <hi>of no mans</hi> juſtification, <hi>being not certain of the</hi> ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>of their</hi> faith, <hi>and if he ſhould adventure to adminiſter upon</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities, <hi>or charitable conjectures, then ſhould he be</hi> guilty of <hi>profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ordinances, and every time he</hi> miſtaketh, <hi>he ſhould ſet the ſeal</hi> of God to a lie.</p>

               <p>Maſter <hi>Hudſon</hi> alſo, towards the latter end of <hi>his diſcourſe</hi> of the Church, propoſeth and anſwereth this ſame <hi>Queſtion, viz.</hi> what is requiſite to make one a member of the viſible Church? his anſwer hereunto conteineth three things: <hi>Competent knowledge, holineſſe of life,</hi> and <hi>ſubjection to the Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which, his anſwer, it appeares that he likewiſe intended, onely that, which is requiſite to make an <hi>adult Heathen,</hi> a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> not at all noting the <hi>common</hi> way of entring into the <hi>Church</hi> and Covenant <hi>amongſt us, viz.</hi> by <hi>birth-priviledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, let me humbly offer this queſtion, whether all ſuch as are not ſo qualified, may be truely ſaid to be no Church-members even amongſt the <hi>Adult?</hi> if ſo, then there are no <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> or unholy perſons in the <hi>viſible</hi> Church; which cannot well be imagined to be Mr. <hi>Hudſons</hi> meaning, by any that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult his, <hi>p.</hi> 9. where we finde him aſſerting that the <hi>difinition of the Church is true of the godly, as well as of the hypocrite,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore true of the <hi>hypocrite;</hi> but if he did not mean to exclude all ſuch as want a <hi>competency of knowledge</hi> and <hi>holy life,</hi> then theſe things <hi>ſpecified</hi> are not <hi>conditions neceſſarily</hi> requiſite to viſible Church-memberſhip, which I preſume to be the truth, as well as Mr. <hi>Hudſons</hi> intention.</p>
               <p>Indeed, all muſt grant that <hi>Church-members of years</hi> ought to be competently knowing, and of an holy life, &amp;c. and this is neceſſary upon all Church-members, as ſuch, with a neceſſity of the <hi>precept,</hi> but it is therefore neceſſary with ſuch a neceſſity <hi>(viz.</hi> of the <hi>means)</hi> as without it none can be <hi>truely</hi> in the Church, I cannot but <hi>deny;</hi> many things are neceſſary to the <hi>well-being,</hi> that are not ſo to the <hi>truth</hi> or <hi>being</hi> of the viſible Church-memberſhip, and ſo are theſe mentioned, as (I conceive) doth <hi>already,</hi> and by and by may <hi>further</hi> appear.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But that this is as <hi>ſlightly conſidered,</hi> and as lightly weighed by moſt that <hi>aſſert</hi> it, is too <hi>too evident;</hi> for how few do hence conſider, that then moſt of our people in <hi>England</hi> ſtand <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members</hi> by verture of their <hi>birth-priviledge,</hi> and are accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to be dealt withal as ſuch; how few do clearly ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hence enforced; not to deal with them as Heathens, or as perſons out of the Church, and not to require <hi>qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in order to their admiſſion (they being admitted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready) unleſſe they have thus <hi>extinguiſhed</hi> this their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt by ſuch a <hi>violent</hi> courſe, as will <hi>afterwards</hi> be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</p>

               <p> How ſweetly would the <hi>clear</hi> conſideration of this <hi>original</hi> Church-memberſhip <hi>common</hi> to our people, lead us to ſee a great meaſure of the <hi>mystery</hi> and ground of moſt of our <hi>confuſions</hi> and ſad diſtractions to <hi>pitch</hi> and ſettle <hi>here;</hi> even in the want of a <hi>more ſerious</hi> conſidering, what this <hi>principle,</hi> ſo <hi>generally</hi> granted, <hi>viz. that we are borne Church-members,</hi> and ſealed <hi>ſuch,</hi> even from our <hi>infancy</hi> might prevent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>

               <p>2. Children are borne to an <hi>immediate right</hi> to the <hi>ſeal</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> to wit, <hi>baptiſme,</hi> therefore they are borne <hi>actually</hi> in Covenant, and conſequently in the Church; for though a

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. It is again objected that infants are not perfect Church-members, as <hi>Ames, non adeo ſunt perfecta mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is a difference betwixt <hi>perfectè</hi> and <hi>perfecta membra;</hi> one may be a member of the Church <hi>perfectly,</hi> that is no <hi>perfect</hi> member thereof; <hi>perfectly,</hi> with regard to being or <hi>ſtate,</hi> not perfect with reſpect to <hi>nature</hi> or quality; perfect <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,</hi> not perfect <hi>morally;</hi> ſuch a Church-member, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy</hi> may be, and not ſuch, as ſuch a Church-member, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>years ought</hi> to be.</p>
               <p>2. I hence aſſume, that <hi>Infants</hi> borne and baptized lawfully within the Church, though they are not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> members (as neither are many growne perſons) yet they are truely and <hi>perfectly</hi> ſo; For theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.)</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are either members <hi>perfectly</hi> ſo, or not at all; for all <hi>motion</hi> from corruption to generation is <hi>inſtantaneous,</hi> and there is no time when ſuch a thing may be ſaid to be <hi>partly</hi> and not <hi>wholly</hi> what it is, particularly this change from a ſtate of <hi>Heatheniſme</hi> to a ſtate of <hi>Church-memberſhip</hi> hath no degrees of <hi>magis</hi> and <hi>minus,</hi> but being wholly wrought in <hi>inſtanti,</hi> a man is perfectly the one, or the other; and not halfe an <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now none but <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> will offer to ſay, that ſuch infants are in <hi>no reſpect</hi> Church-members, therefore they are ſo <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They are perfectly <hi>diſciples,</hi> therefore perfectly <hi>Church-members;</hi> for diſciple and Church-member are ſynonimous, that they are perfectly diſciples, appeares by conſidering what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to make a <hi>diſciple perfectly ſo,</hi> namely entrance or admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into the <hi>Schoole,</hi> or the ſociety of ſuch as are to be taught; indeed one cannot be a perfect or <hi>compleat Schollar</hi> without <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> yea, and much <hi>learning,</hi> but one may be truely, perfectly, and compleatly a <hi>Schollar,</hi> before any thing at all be learned, and a Schollar is ſo denominated, not <hi>quia doctus, ſed ut ſit doctus,</hi> as is noted by many; now its generally urged againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> that infants are admitted diſciples into Chriſt his Schoole by Baptiſme.</p>
               <p>Infants are thus perfectly in Covenant, otherwiſe we <hi>ſeal,</hi> in Baptiſme, ſuch as are <hi>partly heathens,</hi> and but partly in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which ſounds abſurdly, therefore they are perfectly mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church; for as they are in <hi>Covenant,</hi> ſo they are in the Church, the Church alone being the <hi>party</hi> in Gods <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Laſtly, it may be well obſerved that <hi>Ames</hi> his words give no juſt ground for this objection; for he doth not ſay that ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are not perfect members, much leſſe not <hi>perfectly</hi> members, onely that they are not <hi>ſo perfect</hi> members, as to have a next, <note place="margin">

               <p>PRoceed we next to conſider the <hi>conditions</hi> upon which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons borne and educated under <hi>Heatheniſme</hi> may become Chriſtians, or members of the viſible Church. Now, though the <hi>former</hi> diſcourſe concerning infants be of moſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet here lieth the burden and ſtreſſe of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>In general, that might here ſatisfie, which Reverend Maſter <hi>Cotton,</hi> from the words of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> hath given us, <hi>viz. that ſuch a perſon as is by nature,</hi> and birth, and breeding a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> and no Chriſtian, to the end he may become a <hi>Church-member,</hi> he muſt be <hi>diſcipled;</hi> that is, as Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> explaineth it, he muſt be entred into Chriſt his Schoole.</p>
               <p>Which, I humbly conceive, is truely done, 1. In his own part by a voluntary <hi>offering himſelf</hi> to be admitted. And, 2. On the <hi>Churches</hi> part, by <hi>receiving</hi> him and <hi>ſealing</hi> him by Baptiſme, a member of her own ſociety upon lawful termes.</p>
               <p>I grant, that there is ſome <hi>meaſure</hi> of the <hi>knowledge</hi> of Chriſt, and ſome kinde of <hi>profeſſion</hi> of the faith inherently neceſſary of the very deſigne of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> in Chriſts Name; but I think <hi>no more</hi> then that, is abſolutely neceſſary; though a great deale more may, I doubt not, be expediently and prudently required by the Church.</p>
               <p>I would not be thought to condemne the ancient practiſe of the Church, in her more ſtrict and ſevere proceeding towards the <hi>Chatecumeni</hi> (though others have ſo freely laſh'd it) yet 'tis known that the work of admitting <hi>proſelytes</hi> by <hi>circumciſion,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> and Chriſtians by <hi>Baptiſme</hi> in ſo many <hi>thouſonds</hi> in the dayes of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> by <hi>John</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> was more <hi>speedy.</hi>

                  <hi>other Religions, and expreſſed deſire to be united to the Chriſtian Church by baptiſm,</hi> is (with a profeſſed ſubjection to the wayes and Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt) the onely <hi>neceſſary</hi> requiſite to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a <hi>Heathen</hi> a <hi>member</hi> of the viſible Church, and to give him title to the <hi>badge</hi> thereof, <hi>viz. Baptiſme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I grant, this muſt be ſerious, otherwiſe it cannot give a real right, yet I meane, <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſeriouſneſſe as may conſiſt without ſaving grace, and might otherwiſe be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by truth, or <hi>earneſtneſſe,</hi> as oppoſed to <hi>diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, deceit, deſigne</hi> or <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> as before is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
               <p>Now if this embracing Religion and deſire of baptiſme, be thus ſerious, I preſume ſuch a one hath a real <hi>right</hi> in the Church and baptiſme, and may be lawfully <hi>admitted</hi> thereunto by the Church, without further ſcrutiny or examination, after ſuch or ſuch a meaſure of <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>holineſſe,</hi> or the inward ſaving condition of the party; and this I hold upon the following reaſons added to what hath been formerly urged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Heathens</hi> may be lawfully received by the Church now upon the ſame <hi>moral</hi> conditions that the <hi>proſelytes</hi> were in the time of the <hi>Law;</hi> and that both by <hi>parity</hi> and <hi>identity</hi> of reaſon: for <hi>Heathens</hi> embracing the Chriſtian Religion now, are as really made <hi>proſelytes</hi> into the Jewiſh Church (I meane the ſame Church which was then <hi>Jewiſh</hi> but now is <hi>Chriſtian)</hi> as the ancient <hi>proſelytes</hi> were <hi>then;</hi> for though the Church be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in its <hi>outward</hi> diſpenſation and Ordinances, it is ſtill the <hi>ſame</hi> in its <hi>ſubjects,</hi> and Covenant, as appeares undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably againſt the Anabaptiſt from <hi>Romans</hi> 11. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 6, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But now the Jewiſh ancient <hi>proſelytes</hi> were received, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly circumciſed by the Church, upon ſuch a ſingle <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning all falſe religions</hi> and adhering to the true, with a deſire
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:118938:107"/> to <hi>adjoyne</hi> themſelves to the <hi>people</hi> and <hi>worſhip</hi> of the true God.</p>
               <p>Therefore upon the ſame terms (ſupplying what is neceſſarily to be ſupplied, touching the <hi>Meſſias now come)</hi> may Chriſt an proſelytes be lawfully admitted into the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> flock and number, and be baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. That which is ſufficient to make a <hi>diſciple,</hi> is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make a viſible Church-member, and to give claime to baptiſme, as Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> and others reaſon well from, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18.</p>
               <p>Now an expreſſed deſire to be admitted into the <hi>Schoole,</hi> with a proffer to ſubmit to the <hi>Rules</hi> and Laws thereof, and to be taught and ruled accordingly, is ſufficient (the party being thus received) to <hi>diſciple,</hi> or make one a <hi>Schollar,</hi> or a member of the School without the addition of ſuch qualities or <hi>meaſures of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>aptneſſe</hi> thereunto.</p>
               <p>Therefore a <hi>ſingle deſire</hi> to be joyned to the <hi>School</hi> of Chriſt, and a <hi>profeſſed ſubjection</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> ſpeaks) to the <hi>government</hi> thereof, without any further evidence, is ſufficient to entitle a perſon to this <hi>diſciple-ſhip,</hi> and to warrant his reception and ſealing by the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. Some Scripture admit into the Church upon as low termes as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> upon a <hi>general deſire</hi> of baptiſme, and to ſubmit to the <hi>wayes of the Lord in communion</hi> with his Church, as might be inſtanced in all the examples of <hi>Johns</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, with that of the <hi>multitude, Acts</hi> 2. of whom it is ſaid that they <hi>gladly received the Word,</hi> and were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
               <p>Therefore perſons may be lawfully admitted, upon as low and eaſie <hi>termes</hi> ſtill. For, 1. what was done in <hi>ſuch</hi> caſes in the <hi>Word, may</hi> be lawfully done ſtill; for nothing was done unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully then, and what was done then, was written there for our <hi>imitation</hi> and learning. 2. Though ſome other <hi>Scripture</hi> ſhould require more then this, <hi>viz.</hi> upon ſome conſideration, yet rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will prompt us to look for the <hi>minimum quod ſic,</hi> what may lawfully be done, in ſuch places, as require <hi>leaſt,</hi> ſeeing every place and inſtance in <hi>Scripture</hi> requireth <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. A profeſſion that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the Sonne of</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:118938:108"/> 
                  <hi>God,</hi> with a deſire to be united to the Chriſtians communion by <hi>Baptiſme</hi> rendred the <hi>Eunuch</hi> worthy to be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church and baptized, therefore ſo much doth <hi>others</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Philip</hi> required more in his <hi>queſtion,</hi> matters not, if his anſwer had not been <hi>ſatisfactory,</hi> doubtleſſe he had not been baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. He that embraceth the <hi>Catholick faith</hi> or doctrine, partaketh of the eſſence of the <hi>entitive</hi> Church, and he that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth himſelf to baptiſme and eccleſiaſtick <hi>communion,</hi> parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the eſſence of the <hi>organical</hi> Church; therefore he that embraceth the <hi>one,</hi> and ſubmitteth to the <hi>other,</hi> hath all that is eſſential to a viſible Church-member.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. Thoſe, laſtly, that require more, <hi>viz.</hi> ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire performance of the <hi>condition</hi> of the Covenant in order to entring Covenant, but this is ſome-what ſtrange.</p>
               <p>The <hi>condition</hi> of the Covenant is twofold. 1. In order to <hi>covenanting,</hi> which is a promiſe or engaging to performe, the <hi>termes</hi> or conditions of the Covenant <hi>now</hi> to be <hi>entred;</hi> upon performance of which, the <hi>reward</hi> covenanted for depends. 2. The <hi>other</hi> condition is in order, therefore, to the <hi>obtaining</hi> this <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, promiſed</hi> upon ſuch <hi>condition;</hi> which is the <hi>actual</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the conditon <hi>engaged</hi> unto, upon entring Covenant. <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Blakes</hi> Seals. <hi>Hyſtorical</hi> faith may be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates both within the Church, and alſo in ſuch as be without the Church; as <hi>Turks</hi> believe there is a God, that Chriſt was born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, &amp;c. yea the devils have it, 1 Joh. 2. 19 <hi>Rogers</hi> of faith p. 6.</note> The firſt is neceſſary to <hi>entrance</hi> into Covenant, the laſt to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the benefit thereof.</p>
               <p>As it is with men, a <hi>ſervant enters</hi> Covenant, by underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and promiſing to <hi>do</hi> his Maſter his <hi>work;</hi> but obtaineth his reward, or wages alone, by <hi>doing</hi> what he hath thus <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet with leave of that <hi>Reverend</hi> man this <hi>engaging</hi> to perform the <hi>condition</hi> of the Covenant, is, I conceive, more then a bare <hi>hiſtorical</hi> or dogmatical faith; for there is ſomething of <hi>applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in <hi>that</hi> faith, that doth not only <hi>beleeve</hi> but <hi>embrace</hi> the truth, and the true <hi>Religion,</hi> and make <hi>application</hi> to the Church for <hi>admiſſion</hi> and baptiſme.</p>
               <p>However, I humbly conceive, though more then a bare <hi>hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical</hi> faith ſhould be requiſite, yet <hi>leſſe</hi> then a faith that juſtifieth (I do not ſay leſſe then the profeſſion thereof) may

               </head>
               <p>Queſt. THe ſecond queſtion to be anſwered, is, <hi>What is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to evidence a perſon to be a member of the viſible Church to others?</hi> or how may we <hi>know</hi> a perſon to be a member of the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, or what doth render Church-memberſhip <hi>viſible?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer, firſt, that that which evidenceth a perſons <hi>intereſt</hi> in the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the viſible Church, doth even, thereby, evidence his viſible <hi>Church-memberſhip;</hi> for what can better e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a <hi>members union</hi> with the <hi>body,</hi> then its partaking with the <hi>eſſence</hi> thereof?</p>
               <p>2. Againe, that which evidenceth a perſons <hi>communion</hi> in the <hi>eſſential</hi> and formal <hi>actions</hi> of the Church, doth alſo thereby evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſuch a perſons <hi>intereſt</hi> in the <hi>eſſence</hi> of, or his <hi>eſſential uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with, the Church; for nothing can have, or carry a ſtronger <hi>tincture</hi> of the eſſence of any thing, then the <hi>formal</hi> or eſſential <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> thereof, which <hi>immediately</hi> flow from it.</p>
               <p>3. Then further the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the viſible Church, hath beene found to conſiſt in <hi>community, reſpecting communion</hi> in Gods truth and Ordinances, and the <hi>formal actions</hi> of this community have been found to be <hi>this communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Now that perſon that appears to have <hi>communion</hi> with the Church in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and worſhip, or in the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Jeſus, appears to partake of the <hi>eſſential actions,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the eſſence of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>5. Theſe <hi>premiſes</hi> thus laid, I <hi>found</hi> my <hi>anſwer</hi> upon them to the queſtion thus; that, therefore that perſon that doth not
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:118938:109"/> 
                  <hi>plainly renounce</hi> the truth, and <hi>openly ſubmitteth unto, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily attendeth upon the Ordinances</hi> of divine worſhip (whatſoever evil qualities he may otherwiſe bear,) doth thus <hi>appear</hi> to be really a member of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>Indeed were <hi>ſaving</hi> grace of the eſſence of the viſible Church, a perſon could not appear to be a member thereof, without the evidences of ſaving grace; but ſeeing, we have found that it is <hi>not;</hi> we adde, whatſoever <hi>evil qualities</hi> he may <hi>otherwiſe</hi> beare.</p>
               <p>As a man, living within ſuch a <hi>dominion,</hi> and was either borne <hi>there,</hi> or elſe is known to be naturalized and made free, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Laws</hi> thereof, though he be a <hi>great offender,</hi> and highly obnoxious to <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>puniſhment,</hi> yet if he renounce not his ſubjection, or declare not againſt the <hi>government,</hi> is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, known to be a member of that <hi>body politick,</hi> or a lawful ſubject of that <hi>dominion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or, as in the natural body; a member remaining in <hi>union</hi> with the body, and in <hi>communion</hi> with it in its <hi>eſſential actions,</hi> though it be a <hi>diſeaſed,</hi> or <hi>wounded,</hi> or <hi>leprous</hi> member, yet is known and granted to be a real member.</p>
               <p>So a man that ſtands in <hi>relation</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> and ordinarily attends upon the Ordinances thereof, and doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the doctrine of the Goſpel; though he be a wicked and rotten member, is yet hereby evidenced to be really a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the myſtical viſible body, the Church; for this ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidenceth that <hi>common faith,</hi> which (though it avail not to <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication,</hi> yet) is found <hi>effectual,</hi> ſo far, as to conſtitute, or intereſſe in <hi>viſible</hi> Church-memberſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> It may be hence urged, that, then <hi>children</hi> cannot be <hi>known</hi> to be Church-members, and conſequently cannot be <hi>members</hi> of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> May not a childe be known to be a <hi>member</hi> of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> by its <hi>being borne therein?</hi> and doth not the Scripture intimate as much concerning a childe <hi>born in Zion?</hi> it ſhall be ſaid that <hi>this man was borne there? q. d.</hi> that this man is known to be a member of Citizen of the City or Church of the living God, becauſe he was borne there, or by <hi>Birth-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> or being born <hi>free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Children have <hi>viſible communion</hi> with the Church, in their
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:118938:109"/> 
                  <hi>parents</hi> profeſſion, as <hi>Ames</hi> teacheth, <hi>ſunt participes ejuſdem profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. They have ſome viſible communion, with the Church in their <hi>own</hi> perſons alſo in that <hi>firſt Ordinance</hi> of Chriſt, of which they are capable; and thus, being <hi>entred,</hi> they <hi>remain</hi> in the Churches communion, ſo far thereby, until they ſhall be <hi>capable</hi> of enjoying more</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. However it may be ſaid that the <hi>excommunicate</hi> are thus excluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not ſo, for though the excommunicate ſhould have no <hi>actual</hi> communion with the Church, yet they have a <hi>fundamental</hi> and <hi>habitual</hi> communion with it, as a <hi>palſie member,</hi> is yet a <hi>real</hi> member, and may be truely ſaid to have an habitual communion with the body, though at preſent its actual <hi>partaking</hi> of the <hi>animal</hi> influence be denied or ſuſpended; or as a man <hi>out-lawd</hi> may be ſaid to have a <hi>remoter</hi> right, <hi>fundamentally</hi> in the Law of the Land, though he have no <hi>preſent actual</hi> benefit thereby, which indeed the violence of diſcipline, and not the <hi>nature</hi> of ſuch a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> hath brought him unto.</p>
               <p>But, ſecondly, there is, notwithſtanding, ſome <hi>ſecret actual</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, betwixt the body and a palſey member, and the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi> and a perſon <hi>out-law'd;</hi> and likewiſe betwixt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate and the Church; which may alſo be known for that the <hi>palſey</hi> member hath ſome influence from the <hi>body</hi> appears by its <hi>warmth;</hi> that the perſon out-law'd hath ſome benefit by the <hi>Laws,</hi> appears in that they ſecure his <hi>life;</hi> it being <hi>murther</hi> to kill him; and that the <hi>excommunicate</hi> have ſome fellowſhip with the Church, appears in that they are within the care thereof, and under the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God, appointed for ſalvation, and not for deſtruction, and is to be dealt withal as a <hi>brother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The <hi>excommunicate,</hi> laſtly, (I mean, ſuch onely as are not <hi>heretical)</hi> have communion with the Church in <hi>preparatione ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi> and in their deſires, which is onely ſuſpended for their good, a while, with hopes of repentance, and ſatisfaction, and thereupon, re-admiſſion; as the <hi>palſie</hi> member in the <hi>diſpoſition</hi> or <hi>preparation</hi> of nature, is ready, as it were, to <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>ſuſpended</hi> influence from the body again, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the unlocking and opening of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, which a member <hi>wholly cut</hi> off, or <hi>dead,</hi> hath <hi>not.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us alſo of ſome Chriſtian <hi>Hebrews</hi> that had need (notwithſtanding all their meanes) that one ſhould teach them again what are the very <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> wherein they are at once charged both with <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>ſcandal,</hi> yet addeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their being declared to be no longer members of the Church, but rather the contrary calling them (yet) <hi>Babes;</hi> yea, and at the very ſame time when <hi>Laodicea</hi> is charged with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhe is alſo acknowledged to be a Church by Chriſt for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; now, let us take heed of judging without Gods Law.</p>

                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Laſtly, if <hi>knowledge</hi> as <hi>ſuch,</hi> be a neceſſary condition to viſible Church-memberſhip, then no ignorant perſon could be a Curch-member; for none can be a member without that which is neceſſarily required thereunto; but all will grant, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> that ſome ignorant perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> children, &amp;c. may be, and actually are Church-members, therefore alſo, none meerly for their ignorance, are no Church-members, for then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſuch one would be <hi>equally</hi> excluded, according to the <hi>Rule, a quatenus adde omni valet Argumentum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But children ſtand in the viſible Church, in their <hi>Parents</hi> right, who are <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> to have <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. An <hi>Infants right</hi> in the Church may be conſidered three wayes. 1. In its <hi>riſe</hi> or ground. 2. In its <hi>conveyance.</hi> 3. In its <hi>receptaculum</hi> or <hi>ſeat,</hi> as it is granted, <hi>conveyed</hi> and <hi>ſeated;</hi> it
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:118938:111"/> is <hi>granted,</hi> principally, by the free grace of God, whoſe promiſe is freely made both <hi>to us</hi> and <hi>our ſeed;</hi> it is indeed conveyed to ſuch and ſuch infants by the meanes of their <hi>parents</hi> and their <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> and thus the promiſe is <hi>firſt</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> and then to our <hi>ſeed.</hi> But, laſtly, it muſt needs be ſeated in the <hi>childe</hi> it ſelf; who is a Church-member, as well as his <hi>parent,</hi> therefore the promiſe is to our <hi>ſeed</hi> as well as to us, and to our <hi>ſeed</hi> diſtinct to us; the <hi>promiſe is to you, and to your children</hi> and accordingly the ſeal alſo.</p>
               <p>2. That the Infants right is ſeated in it ſelf, though it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from its parents, further appears thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe otherwiſe the childe ſhould have no <hi>right</hi> at all; for the <hi>accident</hi> doth <hi>inhaerere in ſubjecto,</hi> to the very being of it, as <hi>ſuch;</hi> and if the <hi>right</hi> of the childe, which is the <hi>accident</hi> be not in the <hi>childe,</hi> who is the <hi>ſubject</hi> of it, it is indeed no <hi>where, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> may be in another for my uſe. 2. A <hi>right</hi> to the ſame thing (lying yet in <hi>common,</hi> and not actually <hi>divided</hi> to the <hi>partners)</hi> may be ſeated in two or more, howbeit every one of theſe <hi>partners</hi> cannot be ſaid to have a right to the whole (if it be <hi>diviſible)</hi> but rather <hi>in it.</hi> 3. A right may be <hi>transferred</hi> from one to another, yet when the right is thus transferred, it now reſideth no longer in him that <hi>before</hi> had it, but as we uſe to ſay the <hi>property is altered.</hi> 4. Right may be ſeated in one for <hi>anothers uſe;</hi> as it is in ſome caſes or perſons of truſt.</p>
               <p>Yet it ſtill remaines a contradiction to ſay that <hi>ones</hi> right is <hi>ſeated in another;</hi> and 'tis as much as to ſay, that one hath a right, and yet he hath none; for <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum</hi> cannot be ſeparated from <hi>me &amp; te;</hi> and mine belongs to none but my ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As perſons are ſealed, ſo they have a right in the Church, But <hi>children</hi> are ſealed, <hi>i. e.</hi> baptized in their <hi>own perſons,</hi> therefore their right is ſeated alſo in their own perſons.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Children</hi> have lawful <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> in their <hi>own perſons,</hi> therefore the <hi>right</hi> by which they thus poſſeſſe, is ſeated in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſe, ſaith, <hi>Dicimus cccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae filios naſci &amp; ab utero re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putari in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti membris.</hi>
                  </note> for nothing can <hi>legitmate poſſeſſion,</hi> and make it lawful, but a <hi>right</hi> ſeated in the <hi>poſſeſſour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That children have lawful <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of memberſhip in their own perſons is <hi>denied</hi> by none but <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> ſeeing according
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:118938:111"/> to <hi>Scripture</hi> they are generally allowed to be <hi>diſciples,</hi> in <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> to <hi>belong to Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and to be <hi>borne</hi> to him, all which are <hi>equivalent</hi> to viſible Church-memberſhip.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the <hi>childe</hi> had no right but in its <hi>parent,</hi> it ſhould have no <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> but in its parent, and the parents Church-memberſhip and ſeal of baptiſm, ſhould be ſufficient for himſelf and his child; but this is abſurd. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But the <hi>greater objection</hi> cometh now to be removed, it lieth thus. <hi>Conſent</hi> is required in <hi>adult</hi> perſons, for their <hi>being in Covenant</hi> with God; but knowledge is required to <hi>conſent;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore knowledge is requiſite for an <hi>adult</hi> perſons, being in <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and conſequently in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Neither of theſe propoſitions may ſafely paſſe, without <hi>exception,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>diſtinction</hi> upon them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore we diſtinguiſh of conſent as requiſite to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, and thus anſwer to the <hi>firſt</hi> propoſition. And, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of <hi>knowledge</hi> as requiſite to conſent, and thus anſwer to the latter propoſition. Thirdly, of an adult perſons <hi>being in Covenant,</hi> which may be helpful alſo in anſwer to the <hi>whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſent,</hi> is <hi>poſitive</hi> or <hi>negative; knowledge</hi> is <hi>implicite or expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite;</hi> and this againe is <hi>clear,</hi> or <hi>cloudy; full,</hi> or but <hi>in part;</hi> and <hi>being in Covenant,</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>adult</hi> perſons, is either ſuch as they received in their <hi>Infant ſtate,</hi> or ſuch as they received af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were in <hi>years;</hi> according to theſe diſtinctions, I apply my <hi>anſwer,</hi> thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>Poſitive</hi> conſent is an <hi>expreſſed</hi> or <hi>profeſſed conſent,</hi> and this, I affirme to be <hi>neceſſary</hi> in any, that would enter Covenant with God, or his Church, at the <hi>adult</hi> eſtate; ſo far there is no controverſie, eſpecially if we note the things to be thus conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, to be but entring into <hi>Gods Covenant,</hi> and among his <hi>Covenant people,</hi> to be <hi>baptized,</hi> and to <hi>ſubmit</hi> unto the <hi>Laws</hi> and Ordinances thereof in general.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet, I humbly conceive, a <hi>negative</hi> conſent (which is but <hi>non-actual diſſent,</hi> or a non-renouncing of the Goſpel, &amp;c.) to be ſufficient to continue ſuch in Covenant, as before were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether in their infant or adult eſtate.</p>
               <p>Though we grant that their <hi>non diſſenting,</hi> or rather non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wilful with-drawing from the Church of God, is an evident
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:118938:112"/> token to men of their poſitive conſent, and that men are haply upon that <hi>account</hi> reckoned members of the Church.</p>
               <p>As in the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> a perſon that deſires to become a member or a <hi>ſubject</hi> thereof, muſt neceſſarily expreſſe his deſire of it, and conſequently his <hi>conſent</hi> unto it, with his ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Laws and government of that Common-wealth; yet, one that was <hi>borne free,</hi> as alſo, the former, after his freedome is granted him, his conſent may not be queſtioned, much leſſe his freedom or intereſt in the Nation, while he remaineth quiet and peaceable, and breaketh not himſelf off therefrom by defiance, or open <hi>rebellion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that thus it is in the Church alſo, is plaine from <hi>Scripture the great</hi> and infallible <hi>Charter</hi> of the Churches freedome. In the time of the Law, it was requiſite that <hi>proſelytes</hi> were expreſly to <hi>conſent</hi> (as <hi>Hamor</hi> and <hi>Shechem</hi> ſaid onely let us conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>viz.</hi> to be <hi>circumciſed, and they will dwell with us, i. e.</hi> own us as one people with themſelves) yet perſons that were <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. 23</note> borne <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> were to be <hi>circumciſed</hi> by <hi>Gods command,</hi> though without their own, and againſt their parents will; and <hi>both</hi> theſe, as alſo the <hi>proſelytes,</hi> were for ever after to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned <hi>in Covenant,</hi> without any further ſcrutiny, ſo long as <note place="margin">That is, the command was in force, and ſuch children had a right though the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents did not circumciſe them.</note> they did not bewray themſelves by open apoſtaſie; and now in the times of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> we uſe to urge againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> that both the <hi>ſubjects</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> of the Covenant are ſtill the ſame now as then; the <hi>Gentiles</hi> being now ingraffed into the ſame ſtock, and <hi>baptiſme</hi> ſucceding in the roome and uſe of <hi>circumciſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, it is worth our obſervation, that Gods Covenant-people in the time of the Law, were not onely admitted without any reſpect to their voluntary <hi>conſent</hi> or <hi>knowledge,</hi> but command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>renue</hi> their Covenant, in ſuch a manner, as that they that <note place="margin">Deut. 29 11, 12 15 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15. 9, 12 Jer. 34. 10.</note> were abſent, and not in place to expreſſe their conſent, were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded</hi> in thoſe that were preſent. I ſay, to <hi>renue</hi> their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for doubtleſs, they were Gods Covenant-people before; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, can any poſſibly imagine, that ſuch as did not expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to this preſent act, did ceaſe from the number of Gods <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-people</hi> thence-forward.</p>
               <p>3. Though a clear and diſtinct knowledge of the <hi>conditions</hi> be requiſite to intereſſe in the benefits of the Covenant, yet a <hi>general,</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:118938:112"/> cloudy and partial knowledge, is ſufficient to enſtate a man and to continue him in the Covenant of God, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome general and dark <hi>apprehenſions</hi> of the true <hi>Meſſias</hi> of the true God, oppoſed to the <hi>falſe,</hi> that God is to be worſhipped by all his people, &amp;c. is <hi>ſuch,</hi> as I mean and no <hi>more</hi> can be ſuppoſed to have been in thoſe three thouſand, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. in the <hi>Jailour, Simon Magus,</hi> or the <hi>Eunuch</hi> himſelf, when they were received by the Goſpel-Church, and <hi>baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have the reaſon given, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 18. why the people were to <hi>enter, i. e.</hi> to <hi>renue</hi> their Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuch among them as were idolatrous might be <hi>diſcovered,</hi> plainly intimating, that thoſe who did ſo far conſent, as that they might appear thereby, to be no idolaters, which required onely a general knowledge and <hi>own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the Lord, were not to be diſtinguiſhed in, much leſſe cut <hi>from,</hi> the Covenant people of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This</hi> might ſuffice us, yet we have four advantages more to add, with which I ſhall end this anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not ſaid, nor to be thought, that all thoſe that were guilty of idolatry, and thus found out, did <hi>preſently</hi> ceaſe to be of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though ſuch an <hi>explicite</hi> general knowltdg, to be a neceſſary condition of admitting into the Church <hi>adult</hi> perſons, yet this reacheth not our <hi>common</hi> caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>continuance</hi> of perſons <hi>within</hi> the Church, who were <hi>born there,</hi> and <hi>ſealed</hi> in <hi>infancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A ſearch after, either, their knowledge, or <hi>conſent,</hi> in order to their <hi>continuance</hi> in Covenant, who break not out into open <hi>rebellion</hi> againſt the ſame, hath no footing at all in <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Antiquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Eſpecially, ſeeing that ſuch do uſually make a <hi>real</hi> profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their <hi>conſent,</hi> by their ordinary attending upon the <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of divine ſervice; which, for ought I yet ſee, may paſſe for an <hi>explicite</hi> conſent among men, ſeeing, it is <hi>real</hi> and <hi>actual,</hi> though not <hi>vocal;</hi> which conſent none can deny to be given by <hi>thoſe,</hi> that have a very inconſiderable meaſure of <hi>knowledge,</hi> as daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence witneſſeth.</p>

                  <hi>Wickedneſſe doth not put a man out of the viſible Church.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IGnorance hath already appeared in ſufficient, we proceed to enquire what <hi>profaneneſſe,</hi> or wickedneſſe hath to cut a man off from the Church.</p>
               <p>A perſon may be thought to be cut off from the Church, either <hi>de jure,</hi> or <hi>de facto,</hi> or in plainer termes, <hi>meritoriouſly</hi> or <hi>effectively;</hi> in the <hi>former</hi> of theſe reſpects, a man is ſaid to be cut from the Church moſt <hi>improperly,</hi> for unleſſe deſert or fault, and <hi>puniſhment</hi> be all one, a perſon that onely <hi>deſerveth</hi> to be cut off, and is not <hi>actually</hi> and really proceeded againſt, can onely, <hi>properly</hi> be ſaid not to be cut off, as yet.</p>
               <p>I apply my anſwer thus: That ſeeing a profane or wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon before the <hi>cenſure</hi> of the Church be paſſ'd upon him, can onely be ſaid to deſerve (and not yet to ſuffer) it, I conclude, that profaneneſſe or wickedneſſe doth not <hi>properly, i. e. formally,</hi> effectively, or actually, cut off from the Church.</p>
               <p>After all, that hath <hi>already</hi> evinced the truth hereof, I might adde one argument, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> whatſoever <hi>genius</hi> attendeth my <hi>Opponent.</hi> If it be thought that ſaving grace be <hi>eſſentially</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to memberſhip, then the <hi>profane</hi> or wicked (whoſe caſe is now a trying) is either ſuch a one as hath the ſeed of God abiding in him, under all his wickedneſſe, as it was in <hi>David;</hi> or elſe he is wholly without grace, as <hi>Judas</hi> was: if he be ſuppoſed to have any meaſure of ſaving grace, then he can never loſe it, (for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace cannot be loſt) and if Church memberſhip eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally depend upon that ſaving grace, which he hath and cannot loſe, certainly his wickedneſſe cannot cut off this his memberſhip, nor indeed any thing elſe; it is little leſſe then a contradiction, to <hi>affirme</hi> a <hi>particular;</hi> after a <hi>general denial</hi> that cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly admit an <hi>exception;</hi> and if it be firſt ſaid that a man can never loſe that which entitles to memberſhip, there is no room left to affirm <hi>afterwards</hi> that <hi>wickedueſſe</hi> cutteth it off.</p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:118938:113"/>
               <p> Again, if ſuch a <hi>profane</hi> and wicked perſon be ſuppoſed to have no true grace, then (if grace be of the eſſence of the Church) he was never truely of the Church, and conſequently not at all <hi>capable</hi> of being diſmemembered therefrom, either by wickedneſs or any thing elſe; ſeeing one cannot loſe that which he never had, or be cut off, that was never on, or caſt out, that was never <hi>within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If it be my Opponents judgement, that excommunication doth cut a perſon wholly off, this cannot conſiſt with that which we deny, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> doth ſo too; for that which is already done, cannot be done againe (I meane according to the ſame act) but if wickedneſſe which is the fault doth put a man wholly out of the Church, then the man is wholly out before the <hi>cenſure</hi> of excommunication proceeds to do it, (for the <hi>fault</hi> is before the <hi>penalty)</hi> and conſequently <hi>excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is <hi>prevented</hi> in its work, and doth not put a man out of the Church.</p>
               <p>Learned <hi>Willet</hi> ſaw a neceſſity of this conſequence, wherefore, having firſt concluded that <hi>excommunication</hi> doth cut off from the Church, he addes, that therefore <hi>wicked men</hi> are <hi>members</hi> of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Will. Synop.</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie of the Church.</note> Church, <hi>de facto</hi> (though not <hi>de jure)</hi> till cut off, accordingly by <hi>excommunication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Yea, if my <hi>Opponent</hi> affirme, that <hi>excommunicate</hi> perſons, are yet, not wholly cut off from the Church thereby, then my <hi>conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> gaineth <hi>advantage,</hi> and forceth it ſelf with <hi>greater</hi> ſtrength; for if <hi>excommunication,</hi> which ſuppoſeth <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi> procuring it, doth not wholly cut off, much leſſe doth <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> do ſo of it ſelfe, without this cenſure added to it; and if wicked perſons, <hi>excommunicate</hi> have not loſt all title to memberſhip, much leſſe have wicked perſons <hi>not Excommunicate,</hi> thus loſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It may be urged here, that wicked perſons are <hi>de jure,</hi> caſt out <hi>before men,</hi> or in the judgement of the Church, though <hi>not excommunicate,</hi> and therefore they are ſo, <hi>de facto,</hi> before God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This doth not follow; for of the two, the judgement of the <hi>Church,</hi> is firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>nature;</hi> and therefore, the cenſure of God cannot be firſt in <hi>time;</hi> the <hi>promiſe</hi> is, that God will <hi>binde</hi> what the <hi>Church bindes</hi>

               <p>YEt it may be queſtioned whether <hi>excommunication</hi> doth <hi>root</hi> up memberſhip, or break off all relation to the Church.</p>
               <p>It hath been a long queſtion betwixt the reformed Divines and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> whether <hi>excommunication wholly</hi> cut off from the Catholick Church, or the Church of the <hi>ſaved,</hi> though by <hi>Catholick</hi> the one ſide meant the <hi>inviſible</hi> Church, and the other, the <hi>viſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Divines do <hi>unanimouſly</hi> aſſert, and <hi>undeniably</hi> evince, that <hi>excommunication</hi> doth not cut off from the Church <hi>inviſible;</hi> though ſome few of them ſeem to intimate, that it doth cut off from the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>Yet with reſpect to the viſible Church, they mince their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion with a <hi>conditionaliter,</hi> and ſay that upon condition and hope of repentance (as <hi>Trelcatius)</hi> or <hi>potentia</hi> (as <hi>Willet)</hi> an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate perſon</hi> is a member of it.</p>
               <p>However, I preſume, they had as good deny them to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church <hi>altogether,</hi> for what doth <hi>conditionaliter</hi> or <hi>potentia</hi> add to the <hi>excommunicate,</hi> more then will fit a <hi>Turk</hi>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:118938:114"/> or <hi>Pagan</hi> as well as them? may it not be ſaid of a <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> that he is upon <hi>condition</hi> of repentance or in <hi>potentia,</hi> a member of the Church both <hi>viſible,</hi> and inviſible? for indeed a perſon that is no more a member then upon condition of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or in power whether excommunicate or not, is <hi>no more</hi> a member then an <hi>Heathen,</hi> that is not at all, till the condition be <hi>performed,</hi> and the <hi>power</hi> be reduced into <hi>act;</hi> for though there be <hi>degrees</hi> in <hi>power,</hi> and there is a nearer power in the <hi>excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> then in <hi>Heathen,</hi> yet if he be onely ſo in <hi>power,</hi> it can onely be ſaid, that he <hi>may be</hi> ſo, and thereby it is intimated that he is not ſo at all for the preſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Divines</hi> do generally diſtinguiſh of two <hi>degrees</hi> of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the greater and the <hi>leſſer;</hi> if this <hi>diſtinction</hi> be allowed, our preſent queſtion concerneth the leſſer degree of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for I grant, that if there be ſuch a degree, as the greater, called <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> this doth, in the <hi>uſual</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, wholly cut off from the viſible Church; though I crave leave to adde, that there are but <hi>few footſteps</hi> of it, in the New Teſtament, and that in the uſe and <hi>extent</hi> thereof, as it is explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Divines, it belongs to ſuch onely as have ſinned the ſinne againſt the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> and puts men out of the Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of repentance, and as accurſed till our Lord ſhall come; whereby it is rendred impoſſible to be inflicted by men, before that day of his coming, and therefore ſuch as are by <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> cut off from our <hi>practice,</hi> may be very well exempt from our preſent diſcourſe of choice.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the common cenſure called the leſſer (or the leſſer degree of) excommunication, which yet I yeeld to be more then ſuſpenſion) I renue the queſtion, whether this doth <hi>wholly diſmember,</hi> or cut one wholly off from the viſible Church, and for the <hi>negative,</hi> I offer.</p>

                  </gap>here roome for the ſecond? if by the firſt they be put wholly out, how ſhall the <hi>latter judgement</hi> of the Church <hi>reach them?</hi> for what hath ſhe to do to <hi>judge thoſe that are without?</hi> therefore,

               <p>Now that there are two ſuch degrees of cenſure in the power of the Church, is not queſtioned by moſt that are likely to oppoſe me in this controverſie, ſo that this may ſerve at leaſt as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2.

                  <hi>Object.</hi> I know, that all theſe adverſaries are ready to <hi>reply</hi> that ſomething hath ſince <hi>intervened,</hi> that hath <hi>deſtroyed</hi> our Churches.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet, then the objection taken from our <hi>firſt conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is vaniſh'd; for now the fault, it ſeemeth, is found in <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> that hath happened <hi>ſince; which,</hi> alſo ought to be made to appear, 1.

               <p>Let it be therefore briefly examined what they ſeverally alledge againſt us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> object that our <hi>ſchiſme</hi> from the Church of <note place="margin">Papiſts.</note> 
                  <hi>Rome</hi> hath deſtroyed our Church.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Church of <hi>England</hi> was guilty of <hi>Schiſme</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing obedience to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> For, 1. <hi>England</hi> was never an <hi>obliged</hi> member of that <hi>particular</hi> Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but a <hi>Siſter</hi> Church unto it. Secondly, as we and <hi>Rome</hi> were both members of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, we never ſeparated from <hi>Rome,</hi> onely in thoſe things, <hi>wherein, Rome firſt ſeparated from God, truth, and us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>Schiſme</hi> meerly of it ſelf, without <hi>hereſie,</hi> is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:118938:121"/> to <hi>deſtroy</hi> a Church; which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and which, they know, that the <hi>Ancient fathers</hi> ever <hi>denied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> object, that though we were <hi>lawfully baptized at firſt,</hi> yet our preſent members <hi>are not;</hi> and where <note place="margin">Anabaptiſts.</note> there is no true <hi>baptiſme,</hi> there is no <hi>true Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But there are three <hi>rotten pillars</hi> to <hi>uphold</hi> this <hi>argument,</hi> which cannot <hi>ſupport themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Infant-baptiſme</hi> is no lawful baptiſme; which they <hi>themſelves</hi> now ſee, that they <hi>cannot</hi> evidence; and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now weary of the point; and onely labour to prove the lawfulneſſe of beleevers baptiſme.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>Infant-Baptiſme</hi> may not be true and effectual bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, though they could poſſibly prove it to be <hi>unlawful;</hi> and that we ſhould not have been <hi>baptized</hi> till <hi>years</hi> of <hi>diſcretion, fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri non debuit factum valet,</hi> is ſometimes a <hi>good Rule;</hi> an <hi>errour</hi> in a <hi>circumſtance</hi> doth not <hi>null</hi> the <hi>action,</hi> perſons <hi>baptized</hi> with <hi>water</hi> in <hi>infancy,</hi> and with the <hi>holy Ghoſt ſince,</hi> who dare ſay they are <hi>not baptized?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is of the <hi>eſſence</hi> of <hi>Church-memberſhip;</hi> Learned Maſter <hi>John Goodwin,</hi> hath written a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> on purpoſe upon this ſubject, ſhewing by many <hi>arguments,</hi> that ſuppoſing <hi>Baptiſme</hi> not <hi>lawfully</hi> adminiſtred to <hi>Infants,</hi> yet this is no <hi>juſt</hi> ground of <hi>ſeparation,</hi> from ſuch Churches as do baptize <hi>infants;</hi> and <hi>one</hi> hath made an attempt to anſwer them, but with very <hi>unhappy ſucceſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether, <hi>Infant-Baptiſme,</hi> hath <hi>plaine Scripture</hi> proof or not, 'tis both <hi>certaine</hi> and <hi>plaine</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that the <hi>children</hi> of <note place="margin">Lamb.</note> Church-members, are <hi>born</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> and Covenant of <hi>God.</hi> But from <hi>what</hi> Scripture can it be <hi>inferr'd,</hi> that one that is <hi>borne</hi> in Covenant, <hi>ceaſeth</hi> to be ſo, if not <hi>Baptiſed;</hi> I know not, I grant that the <hi>admiſſion</hi> of perſons, <hi>not borne</hi> in the Church, ought to be <hi>ſolemnized</hi> with <hi>Baptiſme;</hi> yet, I conceive, that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is the <hi>ſeal</hi> and badge of <hi>this,</hi> his admiſſion, <hi>rather</hi> then <hi>eſſential</hi> to it; and that, he is a <hi>member indeed,</hi> and before God, by his <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere embracing</hi> the Chriſtian Religion in his <hi>heart,</hi> though not <hi>baptized;</hi> though his ſubmiſſion to <hi>Baptiſme</hi> be a <hi>neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi> of his Chriſtian <hi>profeſſion,</hi> for the <hi>Churches</hi> ſatisfaction; and yet, I conceive, there is much <hi>difference,</hi> betwixt the caſes
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:118938:122"/> of ſuch perſons, and of <hi>thoſe</hi> that are <hi>borne in</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and that this difference is clearly revealed in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of both <hi>Teſtaments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> There is but <hi>one</hi> thing that hath any <hi>colour</hi> of <hi>bjection</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> againſt it; that the perſon not <hi>circumciſed</hi> ſhould be <hi>cut</hi> off from the <hi>people,</hi> and that he had <hi>broken the Covenant</hi> of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 14.</p>
               <p>But this is eaſily <hi>removed;</hi> for, both his <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>puniſhment</hi> plainly intimate <hi>ſuch</hi> a perſons <hi>intereſt</hi> in the <hi>Covenant.</hi> 1. He hath <hi>broken my Covenant,</hi> that was his <hi>ſinne;</hi> of <hi>which</hi> he had not been <hi>capable,</hi> had he not been in <hi>Covenant;</hi> and therefore a perſon <hi>refuſing circumciſion</hi> was in <hi>Covenant.</hi> 2. His <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was to be cut off from the people; which alſo intimates, that at <hi>preſent,</hi> he was among Gods people, and to be <hi>puniſhed</hi> with that puniſhment which was <hi>peculiar</hi> unto <hi>them;</hi> it matters not what was meant by this <hi>cutting off;</hi> for whether it was by <hi>death,</hi> or <hi>excommunication,</hi> we can thence onely argue, <hi>deſert</hi> of the like <hi>puniſhment</hi> in the like caſe; and not that <hi>ſuch</hi> a perſon is not yet <hi>in Covenant</hi> before this <hi>puniſhment</hi> is inflicted which is onely <hi>due</hi> unto him, for <hi>breaking</hi> the <hi>Covenant,</hi> in refuſing the ſeale of the Covenant, which he could neither have beene <hi>guilty</hi> of, nor had any right unto, unleſſe he had been in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly therefore, <hi>faith,</hi> and not <hi>Circumciſion</hi> or <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> is that which enters a man into <hi>Covenant</hi> with his ſeed; we ſay, <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is the Seal of the Covenant, and the badg of Chriſtianity; yea, the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and we are <hi>agreed</hi> in this, that <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is to be adminiſtred onely to ſuch as are <hi>in Covenant</hi> already; and conſequently that perſons are in <hi>Covenant</hi> before they have right to <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> and therefore <hi>baptiſme</hi> is not of the eſſence of the <hi>Cevenant</hi> or Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> The <hi>Browniſt, ſuppoſing</hi> the deſtruction of our Churches <note place="margin">Of Browniſts.</note> in <hi>Queen Maries dayes,</hi> thus objecteth. The <hi>true</hi> Church is <hi>gathered</hi> by the <hi>preaching</hi> of the Word, but the Churches of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were <hi>called</hi> onely by <hi>Queen Eliza's</hi> command, and not by the <hi>preaching</hi> of the Word; therefore they are no <hi>true</hi> Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is the Goliah-objection, yet with no great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>vanquiſhed;</hi> for,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:118938:122"/> 1. It cannot be proved, that we wholly loſt the <hi>being</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi> by the <hi>Marian</hi> perſecution. The <hi>Fundamental</hi> points, touching God, Chriſt, Scriptures, Ordinances, did ſtill <hi>ſhine</hi> through that <hi>red vaile;</hi> at leaſt, they were never <hi>covered,</hi> much leſſe <hi>lost</hi> in that <hi>Popiſh Rabble;</hi> which <hi>God</hi> moſt graciouſly and ſuddenly <hi>cleanſed,</hi> by the means of that happy, ſucceeding <hi>Queen;</hi> ſo that, it was rather a reformation then a <hi>conſtitution</hi> of a Church, which we <hi>then</hi> received; and the <hi>Queen</hi> did no more, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for her <hi>entruſted</hi> power, for recovery of our former purer <hi>Religion;</hi> then what other <hi>Scripture-Princes</hi> had done <hi>before</hi> her, with <hi>applauſe</hi> from heaven.</p>
               <p>The people in <hi>Joſiahs</hi> time were farre <hi>more Idolatrous,</hi> then in <hi>Queen Maries;</hi> the like might be obſerved of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time; ſee how <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Amon</hi> left them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 2, 3, 4. and 23. and 33. 2, 3, 4, 5, 9. yet we find that theſe <hi>Princes</hi> compelled all that were found in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to ſerve the Lord <hi>their God;</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 34. 33. <hi>who commanded the people to ſerve the Lord,</hi> 2 King. 23. 21. and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> with his <hi>Parliament,</hi> made a <hi>decree,</hi> requiring the people from <hi>Dan to Beerſheba to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn againe unto the Lord God of Abraham, whom they had forſaken,</hi> 2 Chron. 30. 56.</p>
               <p>Now who will ſay that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was not a people <hi>of the Lord,</hi> becauſe <hi>thus</hi> reduced againe, unto him, by the <hi>command</hi> of theſe <hi>Kings?</hi> in like manner, our gracious <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> did her duty to God in following theſe happy <hi>Kings</hi> in the like caſe, in <hi>England;</hi> and the people did no leſſe then their duty to God and the <hi>Queene</hi> in returning to their God at the <hi>Queenes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither can it be ſufficiently <hi>proved,</hi> that the preaching of the Word is of abſolute <hi>neceſſity</hi> at the <hi>firſt</hi> conſtitution of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, eſpecially where ſome <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God and his wayes is <hi>preſuppoſed,</hi> as our caſe in <hi>England</hi> then was.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I grant, that in ordinary caſes the preaching of the Goſpel is required to the <hi>conſtitution</hi> of a Church; but that there can be no <hi>extraordinary exception</hi> to this <hi>rule,</hi> I deny; eſpecially when men would thence reaſon us out of our <hi>ſenſes,</hi> as well as our <hi>Churches;</hi> we ſee our Churches in all the parts and <hi>eſſentials</hi> of true Churches; ſhall we yet argue againſt what we ſee, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:118938:123"/> not <hi>believe</hi> our own eyes, becauſe their firſt conſtitution was not as we would have had it, or as indeed <hi>ordinarily</hi> Churches are conſtituted? would it not have been judged a <hi>madneſſe</hi> in <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> to have reaſoned their <hi>parents</hi> out of the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>man-kinde,</hi> becauſe they were not born of a <hi>woman,</hi> as men <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily</hi> are.</p>
               <p>Let who will <hi>undertake</hi> to prove, that our Churches in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were not conſtituted <hi>at firſt</hi> by the <hi>preaching</hi> of the Word, and I dare engage to make good the <hi>aſſumption</hi> that our Churches in <hi>England</hi> are true Churches; and thus we may haply diſcover another (extraordinary) way of <hi>conſtitution</hi> of Churches, beſides the <hi>preaching</hi> of the Word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>preaching</hi> of the Word as neceſſary to a true Church, may be thought to be either <hi>antecedent</hi> or <hi>ſubſequent</hi> to the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> thereof, either of which is <hi>ſufficient,</hi> provided that the people are brought to a willing embracement of the Chriſtian profeſſion by any <hi>other</hi> means; ſo that, where the Candleſtick is <hi>pitched,</hi> and the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the Word is <hi>fixed</hi> among any people that freely attend upon it, there none may doubt, but that God hath choſen a people to be his <hi>Church;</hi> for here are found the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> marks of a true Church.</p>
               <p>Now none can deny, but that our Congregations in <hi>England</hi> (if they were not at <hi>firſt reduced</hi> by the <hi>Minſtry)</hi> yet they have <hi>enjoyed</hi> it, <hi>ever ſince,</hi> that their reduction from the <hi>Popiſh</hi> yoak in the dayes of that famous <hi>Queen,</hi> and that none may have cauſe to ſay, that this our attendance on the Ordinances of God, is generally forced by a Law, (as was wont to be laid to our charge,) we have of late, a moſt clear evidence, that it is indeed, free and voluntary, ſeeing all compulſory meanes, are known to be rebated, and taken away, in the <hi>preſent liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Much leſſe, can it without <hi>groſſe ignorance,</hi> or dangerous <hi>impudence,</hi> be denied, that the <hi>Ministery</hi> of the word was <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental</hi> with the Queens command to the reduction of the people in her dayes from <hi>Popery</hi> to <hi>Proteſtantiſme;</hi> yea, 'tis well known, that divers <hi>Ministers</hi> were <hi>ſent</hi> into all parts, to ſatisfie the people touching that change in Religion, which ſhe then was about, and allowed the people that their returne might be free, above half a years time to conſider of it, and what law was made at length, to compel in any regard, was made by conſent of the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:118938:123"/> people themſelves in <hi>Parliament,</hi> all which are <hi>ſo evident</hi> in <hi>hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that I ſhall need ſay no <hi>more</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>However, ſuppoſe that all theſe things ſhould be granted them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we <hi>loſt</hi> our <hi>Churches</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That a <hi>true</hi> Church can be conſtituted onely by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That our Churches in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, or rather compelled onely by the Queens Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And conſequently, that they then were no <hi>true</hi> Churches, but ſocieties of <hi>Heathens</hi> (all which have appeared to be <hi>falſe;)</hi> yet, what will this adverſary conclude from thence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our preſent <hi>Churches?</hi> eſpecially if we adde the ſerious conſideration of theſe four following particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>our people</hi> have had the <hi>preaching</hi> of the Word ever ſince.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they are now a willing people in Gods <hi>publick</hi> worſhip, all meanes of compulſion being now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they became thus willing to embrace and abide in the true Religion, by the preaching of the Word; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other meanes by their owne principles could make them ſo.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And therefore, conſequently, we ſtand <hi>true Churches now,</hi> by their own principles; being <hi>conſtituted ſuch,</hi> at length (by the <hi>long abiding</hi> of the ſame among us, if not ſo, at firſt) by the preaching of the Word.</p>

               <p>WE have found the former doctrine helpful to us, in the <hi>vindication</hi> of the truth of our Churches, let us follow it a little further, and it may haply diſcover ſomething alſo, touching their <hi>title</hi> to <hi>Sacraments.</hi>

               <p>1.

               <p n="3">3.

               </p>
               <p>Again, if I ſhould adde, that the children of perſons <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Children of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate perſons.</note> ought to be baptized, 'tis well known, that many learned men would bear me out. Certainly if the <hi>Parents</hi> in this ſtate of <hi>cenſure,</hi> are united to the <hi>Church,</hi> and have the <hi>ſeal</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in its <hi>force</hi> upon them, I ſee not, but their <hi>children</hi> have yet <hi>a right</hi> unto <hi>Baptiſm</hi> not to be violared. For what is it that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles the <hi>childe</hi> to the <hi>ſeal,</hi> but its being borne in <hi>Covenant?</hi> and what is the meanes of this, but the <hi>Parents foederal holineſſe</hi> and <hi>Baptiſmal ſtate?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>(praeteritis hic etiam illis, quae alibi ſunt diſputata)</hi> I ſhall ſay only this, that either the <hi>excommunicate</hi> Parent is in <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> or not. If he be in <hi>Covenant,</hi> then his <hi>childe</hi> hath right to <hi>Baptiſme;</hi> if he be not, then upon his repentance, he ought to be re-baptized; for if the Covenant-intereſt of an excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate perſon be wholly voided, then is the <hi>ſeal</hi> of the Covenant <hi>broken,</hi> and muſt upon renewing of Covenant, by repentance,

               <p>Laſtly, it will eaſily follow, that then, the children of ſuch as <note place="margin">The children of ſuch as ought not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> ought not to communicate in the Supper may have right to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; becauſe wicked perſons, and perſons <hi>de jure</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and perſons actually excommunicate, ought not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Supper,</hi> and yet the children of all ſuch, being the children of parents in Covenant, ought not be de denied the ſeal of the Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſme.</p>

                  <p>UPon the firſt of theſe, I affirme, that there is ſuch a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> forbidding ſome Church-members,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:118938:127"/> to receive the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> 2. I affirme that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is to be drawn from 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Let a man examine himſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is ſuch a command <hi>forbidding,</hi> or charging <note place="margin">There is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of ſom perſons.</note> ſomething upon <hi>Church-members,</hi> as conditional to their <hi>coming</hi> to the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and conſequently rendring the <hi>right</hi> which perſons have to the Sacrament, by vertue of bare or ſingle <hi>Church-memberſhip,</hi> but a mediate right, and the <hi>command</hi> obliging Church-members, as onely ſuch, but a <hi>mediate,</hi> or a <hi>conditional</hi> command. I affirm upon theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. For, if the <hi>command</hi> obliging <hi>all</hi> the <hi>circumciſed</hi> to <hi>eat the paſſeover,</hi> was not abſolute, but upon a ſuppoſition or condition of their <hi>cleanneſſe, what reaſon</hi> can be given, why this command, obliging the <hi>baptized</hi> to communion in the Supper, ſhould be ſo abſolute, as to admit of <hi>no conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> at all?</p>
                  <p>Is not the <hi>Supper</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian Paſſeover?</hi> as <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is the Chriſtian Circumciſion? at leaſt is not the Supper as holy as the <hi>Paſſeover?</hi> is not the <hi>Goſpel-diſpenſation</hi> as ſtrict as the <hi>legal?</hi> is not the <hi>Supper</hi> at as great a diſtance from <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> as the paſſeover from <hi>circumciſion?</hi> however, if theſe will not be yeelded unto, I am ſure that this will force its way, that no reaſon can poſſibly be given, why the command for the Supper ſhould be more abſolute, then that of the <hi>Paſſeover.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis nothing here, whether the <hi>legally unclean</hi> onely, were forbidden the Paſſeover. For, 1. The legally uncleane were <hi>circumciſed.</hi> 2. The legally unclean were prohibited the <hi>Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over.</hi> 3. Therefore ſome <hi>circumciſed</hi> perſons were prohibited the Paſſeover.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither is it our queſtion whether thoſe that were <hi>forbidden</hi> the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> were <hi>equally</hi> forbidden all other Ordinances; for if ſo, then, 1. The <hi>Paſſeover</hi> was forbidden alſo. 2. Then <hi>other</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, were, it ſeems, but <hi>conditionally</hi> obliged unto in the time of the Law, upon Church-members; and what ſhould hinder the Supper to be ſo now?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Offering the gift,</hi> at the <hi>Altar,</hi> is commanded by Chriſt, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally,</hi> or <hi>mediately,</hi> (firſt go and be reconciled, then <hi>come</hi> and <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 23, 24</note>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Children, borne</hi> and <hi>baptized Church-members,</hi> are <hi>truely</hi> Church-members; yet ſuch children are prohibited by the counſels of the Church to receive <hi>this</hi> Sacrament, until they are arrived to years of <hi>diſcretion;</hi> which all our adverſaries (even the <hi>higheſt</hi> for the <hi>priviledge</hi> of <hi>memberſhip)</hi> readily <hi>conſent</hi> unto.</p>

                  <p>Such a <hi>practice</hi> as this, could poſſibly proceed from no other <hi>principle</hi> but this, that Chriſt did not require this part of his worſhip from ſuch unworthy hands? and that, in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition perſons ought not to receive the Sacrament; for, if Chriſt did abſolutely <hi>looſe</hi> ſuch perſons to this duty of receiving, and that to the <hi>Churches knowledge,</hi> how could the Church without ſinne againſt knowledge, binde them from it? what is this but to <hi>contradict</hi> Chriſt in his <hi>Word,</hi> and to rob him of his <hi>honour, worſhip</hi> and <hi>Sovereignty?</hi> if our <hi>common Maſter,</hi> do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed abſolutely command us all to come, who dare for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid any, upon the moſt <hi>glorious pretence</hi> in the world?</p>
                  <p>Now that this hath been the uſual courſe of the Church (if not <hi>juridically</hi> to <hi>with-hold</hi> from the Sacrament, ſuch as were <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous</hi> (which anone alſo may be examined) yet <hi>doctrinally</hi> thus to <hi>diſwade</hi> and terrifie <hi>ſecret</hi> ſinners from approaching the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eaſily appears.</p>

                  <p>And doth the <hi>Directory</hi> require otherwiſe? <hi>vid. page</hi> 34. there we read that the Miniſter is in the Name of Chriſt to warn <note place="margin">Directory.</note> all ſuch as are ignorant, ſcandalous, profane, or that live in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſin or offence againſt their knowledge or conſcience, that they preſume not to come to that holy Table; where, alſo we may note, that the perſons to be thus diſſwaded; are not onely the openly ſcandalous, but ſuch wicked perſons as are known to be ſuch by their own knowledge and conſcience alone. 2. Theſe are to be warned away in the Name of Chriſt, which who dare preſume to do, that doth not beleeve that the will of Chriſt is, that ſuch perſons ought not to receive. 3. Therefore, our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors judged that the Will or command of Chriſt, our Maſter is not, that ſuch Church-members, as are thus unworthy, ought to receive, but rather the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Yea, this is generally granted to us, even by thoſe that deny the thing, as wel as thoſe that deny us the power of <hi>juridical ſuſpenſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, this is granted and forceably urged by ſome, that as earneſtly plead, that the command, do this in <hi>remembrance</hi> of me is <hi>inconditional</hi> and abſolute; which I crave leave to ſay, is a contradiction; for if the Command, <hi>do this, &amp;c.</hi> be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, either upon the Adminiſtrator or upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, how then is the Aminiſtrator to warne any of the people not to ſuffer him to do his duty in adminiſtring to them, or not to attend upon their own duty in communicating? to ſay that a Miniſter is bound by Chriſts command to adminiſter to all <hi>Church members,</hi> and againe; that he is bound in the Name of Chriſt, to warne ſome not to receive; is to make
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:118938:129"/> the will of <hi>Christ contrary to it ſelf;</hi> and to ſay, that a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is bound to warne the wicked from the Sacrament, and yet to ſay, that the will of Chriſt is, that all are abſolutely bound to receive, is to <hi>contradict our ſelves;</hi> by the firſt, we confeſſe that the <hi>will of Chriſt</hi> is, that wicked men ought not to receive, which is formally denied in the latter.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this gathered onely from the practice, for it is indeed the <hi>expreſſe judgement</hi> of moſt <hi>eminent</hi> men in the Church, almoſt <note place="margin">2. Churches judgement.</note> in all ages.</p>

                  <p>THis point is run upon by two ſorts of Adverſaries, 1. By ſome, too ſtrict. 2. By others, too large.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some have ventured to ſay, that Church-members, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (to uſe their own terme) <hi>diſciples,</hi> as ſuch, have an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate right in this Sacrament, but none are diſciples, ſave perſons ſo and ſo qualified.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, I do not purpoſely deal with here; for the preſent, they may be contented with a very ſhort anſwer, that both their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi> are falſe, or at leaſt fallacious. 1. That none are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but perſons qualified with knowledge, holineſſe, &amp;c. which they muſt needs grant to be falſe, if they will avoid <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme,</hi> ſeeing according to the principalls of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> all that are lawfully baptized are <hi>diſciples,</hi> Matth. 28. 19. and again, that all that are lawfully baptized, are not ſo and ſo qualified, as in the caſe of Infants, who are baptized, and lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo. 2. That all that are diſciples are to receive the Supper: this holds not, 1. Till what I have urged for wicked mens <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberſhip</hi> be refuted. 2. Till Infants <hi>diſcipleſhip</hi> be denied. 3. Or till both Infants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wicked Church-members, yea, and ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea, excommunicate Church members, are proved to have an immediate and preſent right to the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> ſeeing all ſuch may be <hi>Church-members</hi> and <hi>diſciples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, let us rather weigh what is urged by the other larger par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, againſt this barr, upon ſome Church-members, to keep them from receiving the Supper.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſcornfully urged, more then ſolidly, that then Church-members <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>1</label> by their wickedneſſe have it ſeems, a writ of eaſe from their <hi>duty.</hi> If wicked Church-members are forbidden the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Juſt as excommunicate perſons have a writ of Eaſe from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> Ordinances, as well as this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This gives a faire occaſion to note the ground of that clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, not to ſay, contradictory way of ſome mens expreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:118938:131"/> upon this point; ſometimes, they ſay, all Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are obliged to receive the Supper, at other times, when this pincheth, that ſome Church-members, <hi>viz.</hi> children, &amp;c. are not obliged, and ought not to be admitted. Now both theſe are true, and both are falſe, as they may be underſtood. All Church-members, as ſuch, are under an obligation to receive; and yet ſome Church-members are under an obligation to abſtain, and yet here is no contradiction in Gods Commands, though there may be, and I fear is, in mens application of them, in this caſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And what is the ground hereof, but want of care or skill to diſtinguiſh of Gods Commands, and the force and obligation thereof. Which if a little heeded, may ſerve both to extricate theſe difficulties, and ſolve the preſent objection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The command, obliging to receive the Sacrament, is to <note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to ſome, immediate to others.</note> ſome perſons mediate and remote, to others immediate, and of preſent and actual obligation. It obligeth all Church-members, as ſuch, to receive, more remotely, upon condition of their fitneſſe. It obligeth worthy and prepared Church members im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and actually.</p>
                  <p>To apply this to the preſent objection, I anſwer, that ſuch Church-members as are not worthy, they are under a remote obligation to receive, even while they are unworthy, becauſe they ought to be worthy, and then to receive. And not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is their ſin remotely, though their immediate and preſent penalty. <note place="margin">Wicked men not excuſed from, though not permitted to receive. Wicked men in a double ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, as Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. 2. As wicked, in this forbidden, in that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive. If he receive not, he ſins twice, if he do receive, he ſins thrice.</note> So that, they are not excuſed from their duty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving by any writ of eaſe, but rather ſtill preſſed with a double duty, firſt to be worthy, and then to receive, though the latter is forbidden without the former.</p>
                  <p>This may receive ſome further clearneſſe, from a right appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the ſubjects of this duty of receiving, in a double capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as Church-members, ſo they are commanded, as wicked or unfit Church-members, and ſo they are forbidden to receive: Such, therefore, is the miſery of a wicked man, he ſins twice if he do not receive. Firſt, in not being worthy. Secondly, in not being worthy, and receiving. And he ſins thrice, in receiving while he is unworthy. 1. In not being worthy to receive. 2. In not receiving worthily. 3. In receiving, not being wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:118938:131"/> 2. Again, the matter will yet be plainer, by conſidering the command to receive either ſingly, and by it ſelfe, or conjoyned, with the command of worthineſſe.</p>
                  <p>If we look upon the Command to receive, ſingly in it ſelfe, <note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ſingle or jointly, with the command of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> or ſeparately conſidered from the Command of worthineſſe, then, this command to receive is but mediate and conditional, and doth not preſently, immediately, or actually oblige, without a ſuppoſition of worthineſſe, which is the condition of this obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to receive. God commands, indeed, both the duty and the condition, but yet in his own order. Firſt, the condition, and then the duty. The condition, immediately; the duty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely, as depending upon the condition. God ſaith, indeed, <hi>Thou ſhalt eat;</hi> but he ſaith again, thou ſhalt <hi>firſt be worthy;</hi> and conſequently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou ſhalt <hi>not eat unworthily,</hi> or, thou ſhalt not eat <hi>unleſſe thou be worthy;</hi> for that which is commanded upon <hi>ſuch a condition,</hi> is virtually forbidden, where that condition is wanting.</p>
                  <p>Again, if we look upon the command to receive, in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the command of worthineſſe (as I deſire to do, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this <hi>objection,)</hi> then, I ſay, the command to receive, <hi>viz.</hi> worthily, is of immediate obligation, upon all intelligent Church-members; for every perſon, at years of diſcretion, and in the ordinary uſe of reaſon, within the Church, (whom I call an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent</hi> Church-member) <hi>ought,</hi> doubtleſſe, to receive worthily, and in this compounded ſenſe, by conſequence, to receive; though, any ſuch perſon, not being worthy, ought in the former divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſenſe not to receive.</p>
                  <p>Now, I humbly conceive, thus only, or at leaſt, chiefly, we <note place="margin">We ought to take the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, jointly.</note> ought to conſider the obligation upon members of the Church, to receive the Sacrament, as jointly obliging both to worthineſſe and receiving, or to worthy receiving. God hath put them both together in his Command, <hi>(Do this in remembrance of me, let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat)</hi> and therefore <hi>let no man put them aſunder</hi> in the application, and ſay <hi>Do this,</hi> though you <hi>do not</hi> remember Chriſt, and <hi>eate,</hi> though you do not <hi>examine your ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet, as hath been ſaid, though God command both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; 'tis one, in order, to the other; the one, as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the neceſſary qualification, and the other as the duty. <note place="margin">Yet one in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the other.</note>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:118938:132"/> The text ſaith, <hi>Examine and eate,</hi> yet it ſaith alſo, <hi>Examine</hi> and ſo <hi>eat,</hi> not eat without examining, not eat, though you do not examine, not firſt eat, and then examine, not both eat and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine together, but examine firſt, and ſo, or then eat, and ſo, and not otherwiſe eat.</p>
                  <p>This difficult matter may be eaſily reſembled by a familiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The Farmer going from home, commands his ſervant to plough and ſowe ſuch a field. This command is compounded by <note place="margin">A familiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for it.</note> the Maſter (both to plough and ſowe) and may not be divided by the ſervants obedience. If now, the ſervant do not ſowe this field, all will ſay he is faulty. But if he ſhould ſow the field, and not plow it, would not we ſay he is more faulty? if he plow not, he ſins, for he was commanded to plough; if he ſowe not, he ſins, for he was commanded to ſowe: If he plough and ſowe not, he ſins, for he was commanded both to plough and ſowe; if he ſowe and plough not, he ſins, for ſtill he was commanded both; yea, if he firſt ſowe, and then plough, he ſins, for he was commanded firſt to plough, and then to ſowe. Both are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but one in order to the other.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this applied to divine commands, without book all the Jews were commanded by God to be clean, and to eate the Paſſeover; but they were not either to be clean, and not eat the Paſſeover, nor yet to eat the Paſſeover unclean, nor yet excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from eatimg the Paſſeover by their uncleanneſſe; for a day was appointed by God, when the unclean (being cleanſed) ſhould obſerve it, the obligation preſſed ſtill upon them, becauſe they ought both to be clean and to eat, by vertue of a joint obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon them, though being unclean, there was another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that the unclean, (during their uncleanneſſe) ought not to eat.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> hath gone before us, in applying this to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Firſt, he concludes generally and compoundedly, that every one of years, living in the Church, and being baptized, is bound in conſcience by Gods Commandment to uſe the Lords Supper; and then puts this caſe, What ſhall a man do that finds himſelf unworthy? To which he anſwers very diſtinctly, that there be two kinds of unworthineſſe, of an evil conſcience, and of infirmity, and then concludes, that the latter cannot juſtly hinder a man from the Supper, neither is it ſufficient to cauſe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:118938:132"/> him to forbear, evidently implying that there is one kinde of unworthineſſe, <hi>(viz.</hi> his former) that is ſufficient to hinder, and to cauſe a man to fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bear this Sacrament; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſufficient to cauſe to forbear, without ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand prohibiting ſuch perſons, becauſe of ſuch unworthineſſe, none will deny; and then, here is a general command, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely commanding the ſame perſons to receive, or joyntly commanding them to receive worthily, and a particular command, prohibiting them, at preſent, to meddle with it.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Ames,</hi> in a very few words, hinteth all my mind here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about. He firſt reſolveth, that ſuch unworthineſſe (alone) which <note place="margin">

That this, his unworthineſſe, doth not take off his obligation of worthy receiving. 4. And laſtly, that the immediate duty upon unworthy perſons, is to be worthy, that they may receive, and conſequently, that they ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive until they are worthy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. It is moſt confidently objected by ſome alſo, from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. Thus we are commanded to teach all bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed perſons to obſerve all things, whatſoever Chriſt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, therefore to receive the Sacrament. For as Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion brought all the circumciſed under all the obſervances of the old Adminiſtration, even the Paſſeover, upon their lives; ſo Baptiſm, layeth the ſame engagements upon all the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to come under all obſervances of the New Adminiſtration, even the Supper it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>There are two great faults in the face of this bold Argument, <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi &amp; petitio principii;</hi> it labours hard to prove what is not denied, <hi>viz.</hi> that all baptized perſons are bound to obſerve all the Ordinances of Goſpel-worſhip, and takes for granted, what is, indeed, queſtioned, and ſtuck at, <hi>viz.</hi> that if all baptized perſons are bound to obſerve all Ordinances, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they are bound to obſerve them all by an immediate and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:118938:133"/> preſent obligation under any condition, quality, of indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatſoever, the contrary whereunto touching this Ordinance, of the Supper ſtands yet unſhaken.</p>
                  <p>What is concluded by Analogy from Circumciſion and the Paſſeover, to Baptiſm and the Supper, admits of a very eaſie, yet ſtrong, retortion; for if though all the Circumciſed were commanded to obſerve the Paſſeover upon their lives, yet the unclean, though circumciſed, were expreſly forbidden the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over while unclean, as none can poſſibly deny; then, though all the baptized be in like manner commanded to obſerve the Supper, yet what hinders (eſpecially from this Analogy) but that there may be another command ptohibiting the baptized, while unclean, with Goſpel-uncleanneſſe, to partake of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?</p>
                  <p>Again, it is objected from the ſecond Commandment, againſt <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>3</label> it thus. The Affirmative part of the ſecond Commandment car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth <note place="margin">From Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Second.</note> in it all parts of Gods Inſtituted Worſhip, which at any time he hath, or ſhall preſcribe to be done upon his whole Church, and conſequently this of the Supper.</p>
                  <p>The vanity hereof eaſily appeareth, thus. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond Commandment obligeth all Church-members to obſerve, whatſoever God hath at any time ordained, as part of his Worſhip. But God did once ordain Circumciſion, Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Sacrifices, and all the reſt of the legal rites as parts of his Worſhip, therefore all Church-members are ſtill bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all theſe.</p>
                  <p>Or a little nearer, the ſecond Commandment obligeth all Church-members to obſerve all the parts of Goſpel-Worſhip: but publike prayer, preaching, and adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are parts of this Goſpel-worſhip, therefore all Church-members are bound to do all theſe; which the preſent objector abhors.</p>
                  <p>We ſee then, a neceſſity of explaining and limiting the force of this Law, for which, two Rules will be very ſubſervient to us, and diſpatch this objection.</p>
                  <p>1. The force of this Law, as moral, and morally obliging to <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>1</label> Goſpel-worſhip, is general, and is to be determined, limited, and underſtood, by the Law of Inſtitutions in the Goſpel. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we conclude therefrom, further or otherwiſe, then we
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:118938:133"/> finde to be fixed by the ſaid Law of Inſtitutions, (excepting the caſe of idolatry, of which this ſecond Commandment is indeed particular) which is well hinted in the objection it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> that it obligeth unto all the parts of divine Worſhip, that have been, or ſhall be appointed by God, that is, in any other place, or by any other means of Revelation, ſpecificating and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the ſame, whether by the Law of Nature, as Prayer, &amp;c. which we are not now to conſider; or the Law of Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, before ſpoken of, with which we have now to do, by which the Sacraments are ordained and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
                  <p>So that, unleſſe we can firſt find ſome particular Law in the Coſpel, abſolutely obliging every member of the Church in any kinde of wickedneſſe, unworthineſſe, indiſpoſedneſſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to a preſent and immediate receiving this Sacrament, the general influence of the ſecond Commandment will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing avail us.</p>
                  <p>2. Again, this moral Law of the ſecond Commandment, hath <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule </seg>2</label> a <hi>Negative</hi> part, as well as an <hi>Affirmative,</hi> fotbidding what is forbidden, as well as obliging to what is commanded, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goſpel-worſhip.</p>
                  <p>All the Jews were commanded to eat the Paſſeover, upon a ſuppoſition of their cleanneſſe, yet the unclean Jews were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it; now both theſe come within the force of that moral Commandment; the one in the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> the other in the <hi>Negative</hi> part thereof.</p>
                  <p>So, if we can finde that any perſons are forbidden to come to the Sacrament in the Law of Goſpel-worſhip. The ſecond Commandment, will as ſtrongly enjoyne ſuch to forbear, as the reſt of Gods people to obſerve and partake of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>But, according to the reaſon of a more conſiderable Author, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>4</label> (not adverſary) it may be further objected, 1. That this is to make the Sacrament to depend eſſentially upon the worthineſſe of the receiver. 2. That preparations are required in order to our hearing and praying, as well as to our receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet theſe ought to be done, though we are not prepared as we ought for them. 3. That this is the judgement of all the Caſuiſts that he hath ſeen. 4. And particularly, of Mr. <hi>Burroughs.</hi>

                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:118938:134"/>
                  <p> Briefly, to each of theſe. I begin with the firſt of them, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>1</label> that this is to make the Sacrament, to depend eſſentially upon <note place="margin">Part.</note> the worthineſſe of the receiver, ſo that it is then no Sacrament where worthineſſe is wanting.</p>
                  <p>I humbly conceive, this follows not. For ſome things may <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> be neceſſarily required in order to the doing of a duty, that ate not of eſſential ingrediency into that duty.</p>
                  <p>Divines uſe thus, to diſtinguiſh of the adminiſtration of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme, by one that is not in orders, that the thing is done, but he ought not to have done it; which may fitly be applied to this Sacrament, received by one unworthy of it; that which he hath received is the Sacrament, though he ought not to have received it. <hi>Fieri non debuit factum valet.</hi>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But it may be further urged that preparation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to hearing and praying; as well as to receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, yet theſe ought to be done though we are not prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as we ought for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> We may diſtinguiſh of preparations to a duty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of a duty.</p>
                  <p>Every preparation, I grant is not ſo neceſſarily pre-required, as that without it the duty ought not to be performed; ſuch are the preparations to the duties mentioned, hearing and praying; but it hence followes not, that no duty, nor particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this of receiving the Sacrament, hath ſuch prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pre-required, as is conditional thereunto, and without which we have no leave or warranty from God to obſerve it.</p>
                  <p>Preparation to prayer and hearing, is meer preparation, and not a condition; but preparation to the Sacrament is alſo a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and not a meer preparation.</p>
                  <p>Some duties come upon us without any pre-requiſite as to <hi>fear God,</hi> and ſome duties have their pre-requiſites; and there (if neceſſary) are neceſſary either with a <hi>neceſſity of endeavour</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or alſo with a neceſſity of event; pre-requiſites neceſſary <hi>onely</hi> with a neceſſity of endeavour, I call meere preparations, which, though they ought to be endeavoured, yet, if not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, do not debar us from the performance of the duty; as the want of due preparations do not from the <hi>word</hi> and <hi>prayer;</hi> therefore ſuch commands as oblige to ſuch duties, have always a next and <hi>immediate obligation</hi> upon us, and cannot be termed mediate or conditional.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Praerequiſites,</hi> neceſſary with the neceſſity of event, are againe neceſſary to the being, or to the well-being of a duty, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which, the command, obliging to the duty, is ſaid to be a
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:118938:135"/> 
                     <hi>mediate</hi> or conditional command, and under <hi>this diſtinction or caſe of receiving</hi> the Sacrament falls.</p>
                  <p>But, I have before acknowledged, that the worthineſſe to receive, is not neceſſary to the being of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore it is onely neceſſary to the well-being of it.</p>
                  <p>But is it replied, that worthineſſe is requiſite to the well-being of the duties of hearing and praying alſo?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer this was prevented, as well as foreſeen by making the <hi>bene eſſe</hi> of the duty here to depend on the worthineſs, with a neceſſity of event.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, laſtly, the <hi>bene eſſe</hi> of a duty is <hi>oppoſed</hi> to <hi>fruitleſſe performance</hi> of a duty, and may be termed the <hi>bene utile eſſe,</hi> as in the former caſes of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> and their <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;</hi> or to the <hi>unlawful, unfruitful performance</hi> of a duty, which may be termed the <hi>bene honeſtum vel legale eſſe,</hi> as in this <hi>caſe</hi> of <hi>receiving</hi> the Sacrament and its <hi>condition;</hi> ſo that the ſumme is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Preparation</hi> is neceſſary to the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Prayer, ad bene i. e. utiliter eſſe,</hi> to the <hi>well,</hi> that is <hi>profitable</hi> and <hi>comfortable</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof; and <hi>preparation</hi> is neceſſary to <hi>receiving the Sacrament, adbene, i. e. honeſte &amp; legaliter eſſe,</hi> to the <hi>well,</hi> that is lawful and <hi>warrantable</hi> performance thereof, and this, I preſume hath been made to appear to be the ſenſe, if it be not, the <hi>words</hi> of moſt Divines.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the <hi>diſtinction</hi> it ſelfe, muſt needs be allowed even by thoſe that may be ready to <hi>queſtion</hi> the <hi>preſent application</hi> thereof for, I think, <hi>none will</hi> ſay that 'tis a <hi>ſinne</hi> for an <hi>Infidel</hi> to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>pray;</hi> though he cannot ſo do, as a <hi>member</hi> of the Church) and that <hi>none</hi> will <hi>but ſay</hi> that it is ſinne for an <hi>Infidel</hi> while ſuch, to <hi>receive</hi> the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, it being a <hi>duty preſently</hi> and immediately <hi>binding</hi> upon an <hi>Heathen</hi> to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> and to unite himſelf to the <hi>true Church;</hi> but not ſo, but indeed, <hi>preſumption</hi> and <hi>great tranſgreſſion</hi> for an <hi>Heathen,</hi> while <hi>ſuch,</hi> to meddle with theſe <hi>high</hi> and ſacred <hi>myſteries</hi> of the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude, one may argue as well from the preſent objection for a <hi>Heathens communicating in the Supper,</hi> as for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Church-members; thus, preparations are required of Heathens
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:118938:135"/> in order to their <hi>hearing</hi> the <hi>word</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> yet though Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens are <hi>not prepared,</hi> they are ſtill <hi>obliged</hi> to hear and pray; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though preparations are required of <hi>Heathens</hi> alſo, in order to their receiving the Sacrament, yet though theſe be <hi>wanting,</hi> they are <hi>bound to receive.</hi>

                  <p>It is true, the Epiſtle is ſent to the whole Church, yet may not he that ſent it, ſpeak therein, <hi>of every one in particular?</hi> and though the <hi>diſorder</hi> were a general <hi>fault,</hi> yet I conceive the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 27 Eph. 5. ult.</note> was not properly a Church-fault, but rather the fault of the <hi>particular</hi> diſorderly brethren; and the <hi>connivance</hi> or <hi>non-puniſhing</hi> this diſorder, was rather a <hi>Church-fault.</hi> It is alſo granted, that this required a <hi>Church-redreſſe;</hi> yet I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, this place giveth direction for a Church-reformation, in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>every one</hi> to reforme <hi>one;</hi> beſides, there is <hi>another</hi> ſalve provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the ſore, and put into the hands of the ruling Church in <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 5, 12.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Here we may eaſily note that <hi>ſuch examination,</hi> as <hi>iſſues</hi> in <hi>ſelf-judging,</hi> hath the <hi>promiſe</hi> of <hi>not being judged</hi> of the Lord for <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy</hi> receiving.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Then it follows, that <hi>ſuch</hi> as do in <hi>examining themſelves, judge themſelves,</hi> may come to the Sacrament without feare of <hi>unworthy</hi> receiving, yea, are here invited, yea, <hi>commanded</hi> to come, ſo <hi>let him eat, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4.

               </head>
               <p>SO much for the <hi>termes</hi> of <hi>private acceſſion;</hi> let us now enquire what my former propoſition <hi>inferres</hi> about <hi>publick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> to the Lords Supper; which may (in general) be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered thus.</p>
               <p>If <hi>ſaving grace appearing,</hi> be not <hi>neceſſary to declare</hi> our <hi>intereſt</hi> in the viſible <hi>Church,</hi> then neither is it neceſſary to our <hi>publick admiſſion</hi> by the Church to the <hi>Supper</hi> of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The <hi>reaſon</hi> of this <hi>connexion</hi> is, becauſe <hi>viſible right</hi> or intereſt in the <hi>Church,</hi> declares <hi>viſible right</hi> to all the <hi>priviledges</hi> of the Church as <hi>ſuch,</hi> and conſequently to this of the <hi>Supper;</hi> and if a perſon may be <hi>known</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> to be in <hi>Covenant without</hi> the <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>ſaving</hi> grace, doubtleſſe we may argue from a <hi>viſible being in Covenant</hi> to <hi>viſible right</hi> to the <hi>ſeale;</hi> for who can be thought to have a <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>ſeal,</hi> but ſuch as are in <hi>Covenant?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>conſequence</hi> is (I preſume) denied by none; ſome do, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, deny the <hi>preſent</hi> and actual <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Supper</hi> to <hi>ſome Church-members,</hi> as is next to be conſidered; yet they deny
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:118938:143"/> not, queſtion not, the <hi>right</hi> even of <hi>ſuch</hi> Church-members <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto;</hi> but rather <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> of <hi>right,</hi> and ſay, that <hi>ſuch</hi> Church-members as are not to communicate, have yet a remote and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental <hi>right,</hi> though not <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>right</hi> as giveth claim to <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate poſſeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Others</hi> ſeem to <hi>plead</hi> for an <hi>actual poſſeſſion</hi> of all Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; but this moſt evidently <hi>flows</hi> from an opinion, that all <hi>Church-members,</hi> as <hi>ſuch,</hi> have a <hi>right</hi> to all viſible <hi>Ordinances,</hi> without <hi>diſtinction</hi> of <hi>right</hi> or <hi>Ordinances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>minor,</hi> therefore, <hi>viz.</hi> that thoſe <hi>that declare no evidences of ſaving grace may be Church-members,</hi> is <hi>generally denied</hi> by <hi>ſuch,</hi> as make ſuch evidences the <hi>condition</hi> upon which alone the <hi>Church</hi> may admit to the Sacrament, whereby they evidently grant the <hi>conſequence alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this <hi>propoſition, that evidences of grace are neceſſary requiſites to viſible Church-memberſhip,</hi> doth neceſſarily depend upon prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Anabaptiſme, as is formerly noted, and neceſſarily enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the <hi>Aſſertor</hi> thereof againſt all the ſtreame of my <hi>former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</hi> as appears in the fore head of the <hi>ſole<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>objection,</hi> and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>againſt</hi> us <hi>herein;</hi> which is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Thoſe (ſay they) <hi>that appear not to be in Covenant,</hi> have no <hi>viſible right</hi> to the <hi>ſeal</hi> of the Covenant, the Lords Supper, this is allowed on all hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But thoſe that give no <hi>evidence</hi> of <hi>ſaving</hi> grace appear not to be in <hi>Covenant;</hi> now this I have ſtill denied and laboured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, this is it that <hi>involveth</hi> the <hi>objector</hi> in the former <hi>labyrinth.</hi> For, 1. Either <hi>children appear</hi> to be in <hi>Covenant,</hi> or <hi>not;</hi> if not, how then have they a <hi>viſible</hi> right to the <hi>ſeal?</hi> and if! where is there <hi>evidence of ſaving</hi> grace.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>evidence of grace</hi> is <hi>eſſential</hi> to viſible <hi>Church-memberſhip</hi> or <hi>not;</hi> if it be <hi>not,</hi> then neither to <hi>viſible</hi> right in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as this very objection preſſeth, but if evidence of grace be ſaid to be <hi>eſſential</hi> to <hi>viſible-Church-memberſhip;</hi> how then are <hi>Infants</hi> to be <hi>baptized?</hi> and my former arguments to the contrary anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? to which (for thetſake of <hi>brevity</hi> and <hi>peace)</hi> I ſhall here adde no more.</p>
               <p>But I am here thwarted with a <hi>notable Objection,</hi> to which I ſhall now betake myſelf to give as <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>full</hi> an <hi>anſwer</hi> as the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall <hi>enable me</hi> in ſo weighty a matter.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer in general, that the conſequence is naught; we cannot have a valid argument from right to preſent poſſeſſion; and though the <hi>rule</hi> be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>ſound</hi> that the <hi>foederati</hi> muſt be <hi>ſignati,</hi> it will not <hi>conclude,</hi> that they muſt be <hi>ſignati,</hi> with every <hi>ſeal;</hi> they have a preſent <hi>right</hi> in the <hi>ſeal</hi> of <hi>baptiſme,</hi> but not of the <hi>Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, that I may give my reader my <hi>full minde</hi> in this great particular; I ſhall <hi>rank</hi> my <hi>diſcourſe</hi> upon it under <hi>foure heads,</hi> and give in my <hi>anſwer</hi> to this <hi>objection,</hi> by conſidering. 1. <hi>How right may be diſtinguiſhed.</hi> 2.

                  <p>The firſt branch of this <hi>diſtinction</hi> ſeemes to <hi>fall,</hi> betwixt <hi>right</hi> in general, and <hi>poſſeſſion;</hi> or actual enjoyment of <hi>that</hi> thing, to which the ſaid <hi>right,</hi> is: for, certainly, the <hi>neareſt right</hi> to a thing in the world, is not <hi>that thing,</hi> which we mean, by <hi>poſſeſſion;</hi> neither is any kinde of poſſeſſion, as ſuch a <hi>right.</hi>

                  <p>A man may therefore be as certainly and abſolutely <hi>poſſeſſed</hi> of a thing, as <hi>power</hi> and <hi>hold</hi> can give him, and yet, not have the

                  <p>We might bring <hi>eaſie inſtances</hi> for <hi>both theſe</hi> members of the diſtinction, from the <hi>preſent ſubject,</hi> the Lords <hi>Supper.</hi> 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>remote</hi> right is one ſtep or degree from the <hi>terminis a quo,</hi> viz. <hi>no right;</hi> and the <hi>next right</hi> is one ſtep ſhort of the <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ad quem,</hi> viz <hi>actual poſſeſſion;</hi> ſo that the ſame perſon may have <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> and not <hi>jus in re;</hi> he may have a right and <hi>no right;</hi> the firſt <hi>act</hi> or degree of right, and not the <hi>ſecond;</hi> he may have a right unto the thing, and yet not <hi>ſuch a right</hi> as entitles to <hi>preſent enjoyment</hi> and actual <hi>uſe</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p>This will be ſomewhat the more <hi>clear</hi> by a <hi>double conſideration</hi>

                  <p>Thus, <hi>neerer</hi> to our <hi>caſe,</hi> a <hi>Church-member,</hi> as ſuch, hath

                  <p>We might yet again <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> the <hi>firſt act</hi> or degree of <hi>right</hi> (to the Sacrament) to be <hi>remote</hi> or <hi>more remote;</hi> for though <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>I conclude that Church-members baptized have a <hi>remote</hi> right, and Church-members <hi>unbaptized, viz.</hi> the <hi>Chatechumeni</hi> have a more <hi>remote</hi> right to the Supper: Church-members baptized, and not <hi>under</hi> cenſure, have a <hi>remote right,</hi> and Church-members bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and <hi>under cenſure</hi> have a <hi>more remote</hi> right to the Supper; the perſon <hi>profeſſing faith,</hi> and <hi>not baptized,</hi> and the perſon <hi>baptized</hi> and <hi>under Church cenſure,</hi> being nearer to the <hi>Supper,</hi> and all other Ordinances, then an <hi>abſolute Heathen,</hi> or <hi>total Apoſtate.</hi>

                  <p> This is alſo apparently agreeable with the law and judgment <note place="margin">3. Of the Church.</note> of the Church in every generation, as appears by her conſtant and univerſal proceeding accordingly; for ſhe hath ever ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended ſome perſons from the Sacrament of the Supper, whom yet ſhe did not judge to be without all title and right thereunto; as might be unqueſtionably inſtanced, not only in children, &amp;c. in moſt ages, but in the penitents in all. The penitents were ſuſpended from the Supper, until the Church was fully ſatisfied. But the penitents had a right in the communion of the Church, as the hotteſt ſticklers againſt ſuſpenſion grant us.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay indeed that there were none juridically ſuſpended from the Supper alone, that were not firſt excommunicate, and caſt out of Communion, with the Church in all Ordinances, but theſe alſo ſay, that the laſt degree of their <hi>pennance,</hi> admits them unto fellowſhip with the Church in all Ordinances but the Supper; neither will they deny this Propoſition, That a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that hath lawful actual fellowſhip with the Church in any one Ordinance, hath ſome kinde of right to all the reſt; which right theſe men themſelves cannot urge to be next and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, ſeeing they allow the Church in denying ſuch penitents actual admiſſion to the Supper, until further ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall have a fairer opportunity to ſpeak of this kind of ſuſpenſion, upon the head of cenſure. And indeed, I need the leſſe to trouble it here, ſeeing there is one kind of ſuſpenſion, <hi>viz.</hi> (not Juridical) which is ſo far allowed by all parties, as will fully ſerve my preſent turne, namely, that whereby perſons naturally and rationalſy uncapable of emproving the Supper, (as ſome men ſpeak) are withheld from it: which thoſe who are likelieſt to my opponents here, do not only grant, but make the ground of the preſent diſtinction, of <hi>Jus ad rem,</hi> and <hi>Jus in re,</hi> as it ſtands applied to the caſe of the Sacrament, as is moſt evident in their writings upon this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>This diſtinction is grounded, laſtly, upon the Law of <note place="margin">4. Of Scripture</note> God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the old (Levitical) Law, where we find that the Leper, <hi>Lev.</hi> 13. 46. whom the Prieſt had pronounced unclean, was to dwell alone without the Camp, and out of his own houſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he was re-cleanſed, yet none can doubt but this Leper had
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:118938:146"/> title to his own houſe ſtill; and therefore upon his cleanſing he was, without the procuring a new title, to take poſſeſſion of his houſe again; yea, thus it was then alſo in the caſe of Church-priviledges, if we reade <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 6, 7. We finde, that certain men were defiled, &amp;c. that they could not keep the Paſſeover on that day, theſe men ſay to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> wherefore are we kept back? to whom the Lord anſwers, <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11. that if any that were unclean, or in a journey afar off, yet theſe ſhould keep the Paſſeover (not now, but) on the fourteenth day of the ſecond moneth. Whence Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> ſolidly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that their right is thus confeſſed by the Lord himſelf, and their preſent barre alſo acknowledged, not only a phyſical barre upon thoſe that were in their journey, and could not come; but a legal barre on others that were unclean, and muſt not be admitted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This hath been already made to appear to be allowed by the New Law of Chriſt in the Goſpel. Chriſt ſaith to his Church in general, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> herein is the right, the <hi>Jus ad rem,</hi> founded for all Church-members; yet the Apoſtle addes this Comment, <hi>Let a man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo let him eat;</hi> and herein, (as anon more largely) is the denial of actual poſſeſſion, to ſome Church-members found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Such perſons as do not examine themſelves ought not to communicate in the Supper. Some perſons that do not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves, (as children, &amp;c.) are members of the Church, and in ſome kinde of communion with the Church, and conſequently have ſome kinde of ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Theſe things ſtand upon general principles, and cannot well be queſtioned by any particular perſons, that underſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

                  <p>But let us draw a little nearer to our buſineſſe, and apply the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:118938:146"/> former general diſtinction a little more cloſely to our preſent particular point of right to the Supper, which will appear, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the grounds already laid, to be twofold, by preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grounds or reaſons of theſe two notable poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. Firſt, that every perſon lawfully baptized, hath a right to the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. Secondly, that ſuch perſons as are lawfully baptized have not, by vertue thereof, an immediate, or preſent, or actual right, to be admitted by the Church to the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but may, and in ſome caſes ought to he debarred thete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that every perſon lawfully baptized, hath a right to the Lords Supper, appears from precept, promiſe, and ptecedent in Scripture, and Reaſon grounded upon, or drawn from, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>1. Thoſe whom Chriſt commands to celebrate his Supper have certainly ſome kind of right ſo to do; fot what better right or <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> 
                     <note place="margin">from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. <hi>Debitum agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, debitum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendi.</hi>
                     </note> warrant can we have to do any thing, or receive any thing, then our Maſters command. Thus duties and priviledges are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, what God commands is both. <hi>Theſe things I command for your own good;</hi> and if we muſt do what God commands as our duty, then we may do, what God commands as our tight and priviledge.</p>
                  <p>But now God commands every diſciple, and lawfully baptized perſon, to receive the Supper; and to do all that Chriſt hath commanded his Church. <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> Teach them to obſerve and do whatſoever I command you.</p>
                  <p>This will not conclude, that every Church-member muſt receive the Supper, without any further conſideration. This hath been, and may be further cleared; for this command is but mediate, and conſequently gives but a mediate obligation to ſuch as cannot, and a mediate right to ſuch as can and do not examine themſelves; yet it is a right, though but remote or mediate; and it is an obligation though it be conditional (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition is commanded alſo) and though the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this obligation be ſuch, as we before have heard.</p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:118938:147"/>
                  <p> 2. God hath conveyed and granted all Covenant-priviledges, <note place="margin">from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</note> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> and conſequently this of the Supper, to all that are taken into, and ſealed in Covenant, elſe why are we taken into Covenant? if not to enjoy the priviledges of the Covenant? yea, what is the object of our right by Covenant, but the priviledges of the Covenant. Therefore the Covenant ſtill runs thus, <hi>I will be thy God, and I will give thee, &amp;c.</hi> yea, can we have a right in God the greater, and not in the Ordinances of God, which is the leſſe? <hi>qui habet habentem omnia habet omnia,</hi> how ſhall he not with him give us all things, and with a right in him give us a right in all things.</p>
                  <p>I grant the Covenant is but a conditional Covenant, and therefore a right unto the priviledges thereof, is but a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal right.</p>
                  <p>But now, though differences riſe high about the way and terms of being in covenant, yet al agree that Church-memberſhip, diſcipleſhip, and lawful baptiſm, are of equal latitude, with being in covenant. Therefore, wherever God begins with <hi>[I will be thy God]</hi> it neceſſarily follows, <hi>[and thou ſhalt be my people]</hi> and wherever God ownes a people to be his, is to be his Covenant-people.</p>
                  <p>3. Thoſe whom the Scripture admits to actual poſſeſſion <note place="margin">from example.</note> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> (without requiring any new evidence or title) have a plain and evident right to the Supper, without any new evidence or title. This cannot be denied, becauſe we have no other rule to judge of perſons right to the Supper, but the Scripture; and becauſe that would not admit to poſſeſſion ſuch as have no right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
                  <p>But now we finde, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41, 42. the Scripture admitteth perſons baptized (putting no barre by ignorance or ſcandal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves) immediately, without requiring any new evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or title of them, to actual communion with the Church in doctrine, fellowſhip, breaking of bread, and prayers, <hi>viz.</hi> in all Goſpel-worſhip.</p>
                  <p>4. A baptized Church-member ſtands not at the ſame diſtance <note place="margin">from Scripture-ground.</note> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>4</label> from the Supper, with perſons that are neither Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, nor baptized; for he is viſibly at leaſt, drawn out of that ſtate of diſtance, and being afarre off, wherein the world of Infidels lies; and is, in Scripture acknowledged to be made
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:118938:147"/> nigh in oppoſition to Infidels, Gentiles, and thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 11, 12</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, a baptized Church-member, muſt needs be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have ſome kinde of right to all Ordinances, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the Supper; for though there be a latitude in right, yet there is no <hi>medium</hi> betwixt <hi>eſt</hi> and <hi>non eſt,</hi> right and no right. And if the baptized be nearer in right to all Ordinances, then an Infidel, he hath ſome kinde or degree of right thereunto not to be queſtioned; if he be not ar the ſame diſtance with ſuch as have no right, he muſt needs have ſome kinde of right. He that is not ſo far off from the Supper is nearer to it; and he that is nearer to the Supper, is nearer only in a way of right; for there is no proceeding towards a legal poſſeſſion, but by a line of right.</p>

                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:118938:148"/>
                  <p> The formal grounds are the grounds of the power it ſelfe, by which the Church denieth the Sacrame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So that the preſent diſcourſe is viſibly engaged upon theſe two queſtions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. What are the juſt and lawful cauſes for which the Church may deny the Sacrament to baptized per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. On what is this power of the Church to deny the Sacrament, upon ſuch cauſes, fixed? or whence is it taken or derived?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Firſt then, what are the juſt and lawful cauſes of denying the Sacrament to baptized perſons?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that theſe cauſes are either privative, <hi>viz.</hi> the want of ſome neceſſary qualifications conditional to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; or poſitive, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome apparent ill quality or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, for which a perſon though baptized, ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from this Communion; the firſt is more eminently noted in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and the latter in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. the firſt may be termed <hi>unworthineſſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 29. the latter <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> (or ſcandal) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> perſons under the firſt of theſe may be thought to be unfit, and to be kept off upon principles of care and merciful caution; perſons under the latter may be thought to be und eſerving, and to be caſt out upon principles of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. The firſt, are therefore rather not to be admitted, <hi>ratione cautelae,</hi> whoſe ſuſpenſion, (called privitive) is no act of ſeverity, but charity. The latter, are rather to be rejected, <hi>ratione cenſurae,</hi> whoſe ſuſpenſion (called poſitive) is truly and properly an Eccleſiaſtical puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Hereby it is evident that the latter of theſe, is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the next head, <hi>viz</hi> of cenſures, and ſuſpended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til then; and that the firſt alone falls to the lot of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent debate; where the queſtion rather is what are the grounds of denying of the Sacrament, to ſuch as are unfit for it, then of the rejecting of any from the Sacrament, for their unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it.</p>

But this hath been often banded before, and indeed in places more proper to it, ſeeing we are here reſtrained to the conſideration of the grounds of denying the Supper, to perſons ſuppoſed to be under lawful Baptiſme, and (viſible) Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others would ground the denial of the Sacrament, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Nor want of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace.</note> the want of the evidence of ſaving grace.</p>
                  <p>But this ground hath been ſubverting all along For, 1. We have found, that ſuch as want ſaving grace may be within the Covenant and Church. 2. That the evidence of ſaving grace is not neceſſary for private ſatisfaction, in ſelf-examination. 3. All do grant, that ſelf-examination muſt be ſtricter then Church-examination, and that leſſe may ſatisfie the Church for admitting, then the conſcience for receiving. 4. Neither have we the leaſt print of footſtep in Scripture or Antiquity, of denying the Sacrament upon the want of the evidence of ſaving grace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the perſon were firſt excommunicate, which is plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the preſent debate.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Others fix it upon the want or abſence of a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <note place="margin">Nor vocal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith.</note> Profeſſion of the faith, or renewal of our Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:118938:149"/> Church hath power to call her members to a vocal Profeſſion of the Faith, and renewal of their Covenants as theſe may be fit, though extraordinary means of a general Reformation; but ſhe hath not power to call for theſe, as neceſſary conditions of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to this Sacrament in ſpecial.</p>
                  <p>The ground of this anſwer is plain, becauſe God hath allowed this power to the Church in the firſt caſe, and denied it to her in the ſecond. Such things as are either Scriptural (as renewing Covenant is,) or rational, means of Reformation (as vocal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions may be) the Church hath liberty to aſſume for that great end. But ſhe hath no liberty or power given her, to make new, or other conditions of right in Ordinances, then God himſelf hath made, who never denied any priviledge of his Church, as ſuch, to any Church-member throughout the Scripture, for want of a vocal Profeſſion of faith, or renewal of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>Upon foure conditions I ſhould be as ready and zealous (I hope) to preſſe either, or both of theſe, as any of my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p>1. Upon condition, that prudence judge, upon a rational view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all due circumſtances, this means to be fit, <hi>viz.</hi> ſpecifick, accommodate, and proper for our maladie, and ſeaſonable for the <hi>Criſis,</hi> period, and time of our diſtemper, without which 'tis preſumption, praecipice, and not prudence (whatſoever we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) to apply it. Certainly, cenſures are a nearer and more appropriate means for the Churches Reformation, and more clearly authorized by Jeſus Chriſt in the New Teſtament for this <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5</note> great end, then either a general vocal Profeſſion or renewal of Covenant; yet a great father (we know) thought, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of corruption were not fit to be purged and reformed by theſe Prudence is the principle, and guide, and rule of the Church, in diſcovering and applying fit, and proper, and ſeaſonable remedies in times of general corru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion.</p>
                  <p>But whether this our preſent time, be a fit time or ſeaſon, to call our people to make a particular vocal Profeſſion of their faith, or to renew their Covenant or not, I dare not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; eſpecially if theſe be required before, though not in order unto our peoples admiſſion to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:118938:149"/>
                  <p> Yer give me leave to doubt, that that means, that is, at this time, very likely to heighten the prejudices and jealouſies of our people againſt us, and againſt our proceedings, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unlikely to prove a meanes of an happy Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Who ſeeth not that the great deſigne of the world, and hell now on foot, is to widen the differences, betwixt Miniſters and people, and to withdraw the peoples affections from, by ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up ſuſpitions in them againſt their Miniſters!</p>
                  <p>Again, is it not as eaſie to obſerve from former experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, (of too like a nature) and preſent diſpoſitions of our people, generally, that to preſſe a vocal Profeſſion of faith, or Renewal of their Covenant upon them at ſuch a time as this, and before their admiſſion to the Lords Supper, when they ſtartle at every thing, would greatlie heighten the prejudicies, ſuſpitions, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mures, and jealouſies of our people, generally, againſt us, and againſt our proceedings.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, were all ſuch evil weeds in the hearts of our people, rooted up, were there no aptneſſe in them to ſuſpect us, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize evil of us, were we open and naked to all the world, that we aimed at nothing but Reformation, much leſſe at dominion, and enlarging our Kingdom and power over them, we might, I think, preſſe either of the former means with much fitneſſe to the diſtempers of this back-ſliding, unſetled, apoſtatizing Age; but while this general remedy, remains complicate with this ſtrange malignancy and venome of prejudice and jealouſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and againſt almoſt every thing, that we meddle with, he muſt have more skill then I, that firſt can fit, and than dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the remedies ſpecified thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſhould more eaſily yield to the calling of our people to a vocal Profeſſion of faith, or to a Renewal of their Covenant, provided, we expreſſe our ſelves to make uſe of theſe only as extraordinary means of Reformation; as a refuge to flie unto in extraordinary caſes of Apoſtaſie, or ſecret idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, hereſie, &amp;c. anſwerable to the way of God, as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcried in the Old Teſtament, in his dealing with his people, the Jews then; and as theſe means, are oppoſed to the ordinary means of reforming and bettering our people, <hi>viz.</hi> doctrine, worſhip and diſcipline, and not according to the notion or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:118938:150"/> of thoſe that require theſe things as ordinary conditions of Church-communion, or familiar inſtances of trying the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſincerity to God, or affections to us; our too much valued private deſignes, of advancing godlineſſe and Reformation, with the hazard of peace, unity, love, to prejudice ſchiſme, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable breaches and deſolations.</p>
                  <p>Thirdſy, I ſhould, with all my might, emprove theſe means, in great hopes of attaining the end of Reformation propoſed, were ſuch uſe of them generally agreed upon, and back'd with civil authority.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe, if ſome few only make the enterprize, this means of Reformation, will be found to prove effectual, for further breaches and diviſions only, and end in deſtruction, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a general and extraordinary remedy in this caſe, without civil influence, might ſhew our zeal, I think, more then pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, above all, I muſt ſtick at this laſt exception, that the end of our calling our people to renew their covenant, and to profeſſe their faith, be not to diſcerne who are in covenant, and who not, (as ſome preſſe it) or who are to be admitted to the Table of the Lord, and who not, (as others) but (probable) Reformation of the people indeed.</p>
                  <p>It is not within the power of Prudence to propoſe ſuch ends, to ſuch means, nor indeed according to her good nature; which ſtrives to better all, but abhorres to injure any; for that's no prudence but carnal reaſon, that would go to good in the way of evil, or forgetteth love and violateth right upon the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pretence in the world.</p>
                  <p>Have ſuch baptized perſons, as appear to be knowing, and free of ſcandal, a right in Covenant, and a juſt claim to this ſeal, thereof or not? if not, it behoveth us, to ſhew their bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e in Scripture, and to make our exception againſt their claim, and not to call them to further conditions, not owned by Scripture. But if, then how can prudence, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and rules in things <hi>adiapharous,</hi> and indifferent only, deny that which is juſtly claim'd, and ſo neceſſary. God hath already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, what is juſt and neceſſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, and men have not to do to alter this, upon any pretence of prudence. Why ſhould we fear the event of juſtice as the end of juſt wayes, <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:118938:150"/>
                  <p> Fourthly, there are many that make <hi>particular examination</hi> in point of knowledge, a neceſſary antecedent to <hi>admiſſion</hi> to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and the peoples <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> thereunto, a neceſſary and indiſpenſable <hi>condition</hi> of their <hi>right</hi> in the Sacrament in the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is alſo too <hi>rigid</hi> for <hi>moderate Presbyterian</hi> principles; we <hi>read</hi> not of any <hi>ſuch</hi> condition of admiſſion to the Supper in the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> but rather that ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> the diſciples were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted without it by Chriſt himſelf, and thoſe <hi>many</hi> (in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.) by his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed the ſatisfaction of the Church, touching their <hi>knowledge</hi> that would receive, may be thought neceſſary, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>ſome</hi> means or other for this ſatisfaction (as more at large anon;) but that this particular way of examination, is the <hi>ſole</hi> meanes of this ſatisfaction, or the neceſſary meanes thereof, or the neceſſary <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>admiſſion</hi> to the Sacrament, I deſpair to ſee evinced; yea, I am bold to conclude, that if ſatisfaction of knowledge be the onely end of examination, that this end may be obtained without this <hi>meanes,</hi> and conſequently <hi>this</hi> meanes is not <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> for this end, and therefore <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> to <hi>this</hi> meanes is not abſolutely neceſſary in order to the peoples <hi>admiſſion</hi> to the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, neither is an <hi>incapacity</hi> to <hi>improve</hi> this Sacrament, the <hi>ſole</hi> or <hi>immediate</hi> ground of the Churches denying this Sacrament <note place="margin">Nor an inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> to any of her members.</p>
                  <p>I grant that none are to be denied it, but thoſe that appear to be thus <hi>incapable;</hi> yet their <hi>incapacity</hi> is but the remote ground thereof; may be thought to be the <hi>ground</hi> or reaſon of our <hi>rule</hi> for <hi>ſuſpention,</hi> or the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>prohibition</hi> in Scripture; but <hi>this word</hi> of <hi>prohibition,</hi> in Scripture, is the <hi>next</hi> ground of <hi>ſuſpenſion;</hi> we put away perſons from this communion, who are uncapable of improving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not <hi>directly</hi> and properly becauſe they are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable,</hi> but becauſe the <hi>word prohibites</hi> perſons incapable from it.</p>
                  <p>For, if the <hi>word</hi> ſhould admit ſuch as are incapable, whoſe <hi>deed</hi> ſhould reject them? if God allow them to partake, what man dare <hi>deny</hi> them? if <hi>Religion command</hi> them to receive, what <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> (grounded upon any unfitneſſe) ſhall <hi>forbid</hi> them? or what <hi>prudence, reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi> can there be in pretence of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:118938:151"/> 
                     <hi>pleaſing God</hi> by <hi>croſſing</hi> his <hi>Will?</hi> or what pretence of <hi>charity,</hi> juſtice, or fidelity in a <hi>Steward,</hi> will colour his <hi>denying</hi> any of the <hi>ſervants</hi> the <hi>right</hi> his <hi>Maſter</hi> hath given him, or <hi>forbidding</hi> the duty which his maſter requires of him, I need not make <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides the word of prohibition in Scripture, which is next to be ſought for, doth not leave it at large to <hi>prudence</hi> to <hi>judge what is</hi> an incapacity to improve the Sacrament, and what not, but determines and <hi>fixeth</hi> us to a <hi>certaine kinde</hi> of incapacity, <hi>viz.</hi> whereby we diſcerne not the <hi>Lords body,</hi> or <hi>ſuch</hi> as conſiſteth not with <hi>ſelf-examination</hi> (as anone will appear;) therefore the work of prudence herein is yet more narrow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prudence</hi> may not plead thus, <hi>ſuch</hi> perſons are <hi>uncapable</hi> of improving the Supper, therefore they ought not to receive it; nor thus, the <hi>word forbiddeth</hi> perſons uncapable to receive, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perſons uncapable, ought not to be admitted onely thus, the word forbiddeth perſons <hi>thus</hi> and thus <hi>uncapable,</hi> or uncapable in <hi>ſuch and ſuch reſpects,</hi> therefore <hi>ſuch</hi> uncapable perſons ought not to receive; and conſequently (they appearing ſuch) not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and this and no <hi>other</hi> I take to be the ſenſe of that very worthy and learned man, that hath treated excellently upon this <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Blak.</hi> ſeals.</note> particular.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The poſitive grounds of denying the Supper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having found the <hi>former</hi> grounds <hi>too weak</hi> to <hi>beare</hi> up <note place="margin">The poſitive grounds of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, &amp;c.</note> the practice of <hi>denying</hi> the Sacrament to <hi>Church-members;</hi> we proceed to fix it upon <hi>a firmer foundation,</hi> viz. the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, I know no other Scripture ſo apt to warrant us in <hi>this</hi> practice, as that which <hi>prohibites ſome</hi> Church-members to <hi>receive</hi> the Sacrament, which <hi>hath</hi> been found in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Let a man examine himſelf and ſo let him eat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that our <hi>ground</hi> for <hi>denying</hi> the Sacrament, &amp;c. lieth fairly, and directly <hi>thus;</hi> ſuch perſons as do not examine themſelves, ought not to receive, and conſequently deſerve not to be <hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> to that which they ought not to <hi>have;</hi> neither have they any <hi>wrong</hi> done them, if <hi>men deny</hi> them what <hi>God forbids</hi> them, or what they have <hi>no right</hi> in.</p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:118938:151"/>
                  <p> So that our <hi>ground</hi> for <hi>denying</hi> the Sacrament, &amp;c. lieth fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and directly thus; ſuch perſons as do not <hi>examine themſelves,</hi> ought not to receive, and conſequently deſerve not to be <hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> to that which they ought not to <hi>have:</hi> neither have they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>wrong</hi> done them, if <hi>men deny</hi> then what <hi>God forbids</hi> them, or what they have no right in.</p>
                  <p>So that, if the <hi>queſtion</hi> be, <hi>what</hi> is the <hi>cauſe</hi> for which we <hi>deny</hi> the Sacrament to <hi>ſome</hi> Church-members; the <hi>anſwer</hi> is at hand, not becauſe they are no <hi>diſciples,</hi> or becauſe they <hi>want true grace,</hi> or becauſe they <hi>do not renew</hi> their <hi>Covenant,</hi> or make a <hi>vocal profeſſion</hi> of their faith, or becauſe they <hi>ſubmit</hi> not to particular <hi>examination,</hi> or becauſe they do not <hi>examine themſelves;</hi> which is the very <hi>condition</hi> of their right in this <hi>eating</hi> and drinking, <hi>fixed</hi> in theſe <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, if I may ſpeak <hi>freely,</hi> I muſt needs confeſſe, that I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>fully perſwaded,</hi> that as <hi>this Text</hi> [1 Cor. 11. 28.] is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, ſo it muſt be determined at laſt, when all <hi>vain jang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> are ended, touching both perſons <hi>coming,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing admitted,</hi> or <hi>abſtaining</hi> and being ſuſpended from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                  <p>My meaning is, that if <hi>this</hi> ſaid Text, [1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28.] be <hi>once</hi> proved <hi>not</hi> to <hi>forbid</hi> the Supper to ſuch as <hi>do not examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> but onely to <hi>require</hi> ſelf-examination, as a <hi>meer prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to <hi>this,</hi> as to <hi>other</hi> Ordinances; we muſt ceaſe for ever, from <hi>deterring</hi> any perſon, great or ſmall within the Church, from the Sacrament, or denying the Sacrament to any ſuch private ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtention, <hi>publick</hi> ſuſpenſion, whether by <hi>doctrine</hi> or <hi>diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi> fall to the <hi>ground</hi> for want of ſomething to <hi>beare</hi> them up.</p>
                  <p>Again, on the other ſide, if <hi>this</hi> Text (as but <hi>few</hi> have <hi>hitherto</hi> doubted) require <hi>ſelf-examination,</hi> not onely as <hi>preparatory,</hi> but as <hi>conditional</hi> to right in this Sacrament; ſo that all thoſe are <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited</hi> communion therein, that <hi>do not</hi> examine themſelves; I think, we have plaine cauſe, hence, not onely to <hi>charge ſuch</hi> as do not perform this condition, that they meddle not with this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; but alſo, to deny the Sacrament unto all <hi>ſuch</hi> as we <hi>know</hi> do not examine themſelves.</p>
                  <p>So that the <hi>ſtreſſe</hi> of the controverſie reſting here, we could

                  <p>However, in the mean while, this giveth me ſome <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> that thoſe that do expreſſe themſelves with any clearneſſe for the dening the Sacrament to any that are within the Church, do ground it upon this Text.</p>

                  <p>The perſons under Church power are <hi>allowed</hi> this dommunion in the Word of God or not; if <hi>they be</hi> allowed it by the word; how can <hi>mutual conſent</hi> warrant the <hi>Church</hi> to diſallow it? if <hi>not,</hi> then it is <hi>determined before</hi> by the <hi>word,</hi> that ſuch perſons ſhould not be admitted, that wicked perſons ſhould be put away from among us; and then the power in the Church to do this, is plainly derived thence; I mean from thoſe Scriptures, and not
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:118938:154"/> from mutual conſent, though this be very uſeful <hi>quoad exercitium,</hi> for the putting of this power in execution, according to thoſe Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>To me, this ſeems nothing, but a pretty device to make the confederated Churches fall to the ground between two extreams. They have hitherto pleaded much for Scripture, for every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of Church-government; but thus, they ſhould ſtride too large from hence, upon the ſole ground of prudence, and mutual conſent, for the very ſubſtance of it, as if the former Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis would bear neither any longer.</p>
                  <p>4. Neither is this power grounded on <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 6. or ſuch like Scriptures; for we here treat of that power to ſuſpend ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as are not cenſured, but dogs and ſwine (if they be within) are debarred the Sacrament, as they are Juridically ſuch, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cenſure.</p>
                  <p>5. Laſtly, neither is it concluded in the power of judging, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. this is the warrant of denying Communion to ſuch as are wicked, and to be judged and caſt out <hi>qua wicked:</hi> and conſequently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the next head, <hi>viz.</hi> of cenſure, whereas our preſent debate, is touching the communion of ſuch as are ignorant, and as they are ſuch. 'Tis true, an ignorant perſon may be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly ſo, and 'tis poſſible, that for this ſcandalous ignorance, he may lawfully be cenſured by the Church, yet then 'tis plain, that ſuch a one is cenſured <hi>qua ſcandalous,</hi> or ſcandalouſly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and not properly or ſtrictly <hi>qua ignorant,</hi> or for want of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to examine himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But, if this power of denying the Sacrament to the ignorant, <note place="margin">The power of denying the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively fixed.</note> be not founded in Reaſon, Prudence, mutual conſent, or on <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 6. or 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. where then may we fix it? or whence may we warrant it?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, this power is founded in our ſtewardly and miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial <note place="margin">In our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity given us for edification.</note> office, wherewith authority is evidently given us for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not for deſtruction, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 108. <hi>i. e.</hi> to diſpenſe our ſacred truſt in Gods Ordinances, for the beſt advantage of our peoples ſoules. Here we know, the great command is, <hi>Let all things be done to edifying,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 26. to this great end we muſt level all our miniſterial actions, watching for the ſouls of our people, as thoſe that muſt give an account. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. and following after ſuch things as make unto edification, <hi>Rom.</hi>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:118938:155"/> 14. 19. wherefore, no further excuſe in all kinde of charges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and our actions, ſeemeth needful, but only this of the Apoſtle, <hi>We have done all things, dearly beloved, to your edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 19.</p>
                  <p>Whence the Argument riſeth thus. Upon theſe and the like Scriptures, our (Miniſterial) authority, to do all things for the <note place="margin">The Argu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.</note> edification of our people, as edification is oppoſed to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is clearly grounded. But denying the Sacrament to the groſſely ignorant, is for the edification of the people, as edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is oppoſed to deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe Propoſitions can be limited only, 1. To <note place="margin">The Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it.</note> all ſuch things as are allowed by the Scriptures, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Will of God therein revealed. And thus, indeed it muſt needs be limited, otherwiſe it implies an apparent contradiction, for God hath forbidden nothing that is for edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. 2. To all ſuch things as belong only to the manner and circumſtances of applying or diſpenſing the Ordinances, and not to the ſubſtance or matter of them; for thus alſo it muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape a contradiction; ſeeing no Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To all ſuch things as openly, plainly, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tend to edification, as oppoſed to deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Now, if our Minor, be found true, with all theſe limitations; none, I preſume, will deny the concluſion. But the Minor is true with theſe limitations. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The keeping back ignorant perſons from the Supper, is <note place="margin">God hath not forbidden us to keep back the ignorant, but allowed.</note> one of thoſe things, which God hath not forbidden, but rather allowed in Scripture, as almoſt all do acknowledge; yea, are they not forbidden (while thus groſſely ignorant) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it?</p>
                  <p>Indeed, if ſuch as are ignorant had an immediate right in this Communion granted them by God in Scripture. I conceive, all the caution in the world could not warrant one ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſuſpenſion from it. The Rule, <hi>Give unto all their dues,</hi> is of indiſpenſable obligation; but ſeeing ignorant perſons have no ſuch immediate right in the Supper, what injury or wrong is there done them, by denying it to them? God forbids, and we his ſervants only withhold what he forbids, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sacrament
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:118938:155"/> to ignorant perſons, or ſuch as cannot examine themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have occaſion to note, that all our concluſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout right in, acceſſion, or admiſſion to, and diſſwaſion or <note place="margin">All ſtill meet upon 1 Cor. 11 28</note> ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament, with reference to knowledge or ignorance, are ſtill found to reſt upon this Baſis of [1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28.] for, as hath been urged, if this text doth not deny this Communion to ſuch as do not examine themſelves; I ſee not how any Church-member, though but a childe or fool, &amp;c. can lawfully be deterred or debarred from it; but if it do imply a prohibition of ſuch as cannot examine themſelves, becauſe they do not; I think it fairly follows, thar Miniſters have power in their very office to deny it to thoſe that (they are ſure) do not, becauſe they cannot, <hi>viz.</hi> the ignorant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The denying the Sacrament to ignorant perſons, is one of thoſe actions that are not ſubſtantial, but only circumſtantial to <note place="margin">This denial of the Supper is but circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial to Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, &amp;c.</note> Gods Ordinances; for we acknowledge the Ordinance of the Supper, in Chriſts own Inſtitution and Command; and in its appointed elements and actions accordingly; and thus we do adminiſter it in the Church of God. Again, we have laboured before to prove, that ſuch as cannot examine themſelves are by prohibition and Ordinance of Chriſt, to abſtain and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; ſo that for a Miniſter to deny the Communion to ſuch, is not to create a new Ordinance, but only to be helpful to our brethren, in putting that Ordinance or Prohibition of Chriſt into execution; excluding thoſe whom Chriſt excludes, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting thoſe only whom Chriſt admits.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, the denying of the Supper to ignorant perſons, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo one of thoſe things that do openly, plainly, and directly tend <note place="margin">3. It directly tends to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> unto edification, as edification is oppoſed to deſtruction; for that tends plainly and directly unto edification, as edification is oppoſed to deſtruction, that doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and directly preſerve and keep from ſin and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but now, denial of this Sacrament to the groſſely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, ſuch as cannot <hi>diſcerne the Lords body,</hi> or <hi>examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> doth directly and plainly preſerve and keep from ſinne, <hi>viz. the guilt of the body and blood of Chriſt;</hi> and judgement, <hi>viz. eating and drinking damnation to our ſelves,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 26, 27, 28, 29</p>

                  <p> True, to ſuch as are worthy, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to communicate in it, the Sacrament is directly and properly a means of their edification; yea, ſo it is in it ſelfe, and in its own nature, it being ordained of God for edification; but yet it is not ſo to all, not to heathens without, or thoſe within that have no right in it, and whom God forbids to meddle with it. The Sacrament cannot be a proper means of edification to thoſe, for whom it was not appointed; for the end and uſe of Sacraments depend upon their appointment; but now the Sacrament was not appointed for the groſſely ignorant, or ſuch as cannot examine themſelves, or diſcern the Lords body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The denying the Sacrament to ſuch as ſin by receiving, as well as in receiving of it, is not an accidental, but a direct and proper means of edification; as edification is oppoſed to deſtruction; for what can be more properly ſaid to be a means of ſuch edification, then that which doth immediately hinder from ſin? but the denying the Sacrament to thoſe that cannot examine themſelves, &amp;c. is to deny it to ſuch as ſin by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as well as in receiving it, I mean, <hi>whoſe very receiving is a ſin;</hi> for ſuch as are prohibited to receive by the Law of God, therefore <hi>(ſin being the tranſgreſſion of the Law)</hi> the very receiving of ſuch (againſt the Law of God) is ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Denying Communion in general, to the excommunicate, is a direct and proper mean of edification, as edification is oppoſed to deſtruction; for that, no doubt, is a proper mean for ſuch an end, as God himſelf hath appointed for that end, and is to be executed in a direct intention and order to that end; but ſo is denying Communion in general to the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, appointed of God, and to be executed by the Church in a direct intention and order to edification, as edification is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to deſtruction, as is plain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5, 13.</p>
                  <p>Now to apply this, if all Communion wherein this part of the Supper is included, may be denied; and this denial be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and proper mean of edification, &amp;c. what ſhould hinder, but that the denial of this part alſo, to thoſe whoſe very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it would be ſinful, may be a direct and proper means of edification, as edification is oppoſed to deſtruction, that
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:118938:156"/> is, a direct and proper means of hindring deſtruction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of edification.</p>
                  <p>But here the great queſtion is, how or by what meanes <note place="margin">How may the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant be found out.</note> 
                     <label type="milestone">

                     </label> may ſuch, as are thus groſſely ignorant, be detected or found out? which way may Miniſters proceed to diſcover ignorant perſons?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, firſt in general, by this Argument, that which commands the end alloweth the means, which neceſſarily help <label type="milestone">

                     </label> or ſerve unto the end; this muſt needs be yielded us, as the moſt eaſie and reaſonable limitation of the Rule; <hi>poſito fine, ponuntur media.</hi> Therefore, ſuch means as are neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to this end of diſcovering the groſſely ignorant, and ſuch as cannot examine themſelves, muſt needs be allowed, and for my part, I deſire, I plead for no more.</p>
                  <p>This will be generally granted me; but yet ſome very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and worthy men, will limit the uſe of theſe means of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering <label type="milestone">

                  <p>To this I anſwer, that to me it ſeemeth, not only unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table but unreaſonable, to uſe means of diſcovering the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> of ſuch, whoſe knowledge we are ſatisfied of before, to this end, that we may diſcover their knowledge; this is but to ſeek the groat which is already found; and the like unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe and unreaſonableneſſe is alſo diſcovered, by uſing means to diſcover ignorance, which is not liable to any faire ſuſpition.</p>
                  <p>But the great doubt is, who may be thought to be ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I conceive, we ſhall not differ with many, if in general we ſay, that this ſuſpition taketh in all the younger ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <label type="milestone">

The ground of this ſuſpition lieth thus; we know that all theſe were ignorant, and we have not been ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of their knowledge; as becauſe, we know that a perſon excommunicate was ſcandalous, he is ſtill juſtly liable to ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, until we are ſatisfied of his repentance. This, I think, is generally allowed us, ſeeing few deny us the liberty of examining youth, in order to their admiſſion to the Supper; which, I do verily beleeve (give me leave to ſay ſo, without offence) if well
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:118938:157"/> emproved, might lay a ground-work of a better Reformation, for the next Age, then we ſhall ever ſee, by the zealous preſſing the neceſſity of examination upon all, in the preſent evil and froward generation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither, I preſume, do any doubt, but that ſome of the <note place="margin">2.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may appear almoſt unreaſonable in earthly things; hence they may be fairly ſuſpected to be groſſe and ignorant in heavenly things, which are further off from our underſtandings, as our Saviour reaſoned with <hi>Nic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Or if a perſon hath never from his youth, given any ſatisfaction of his knowledge, in the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Religion to the Church, or his brethren; he may, upon the ſame grounds, as the younger ſort of the people, be ſtill under the ſuſpition of the Church, and accordingly liable to the Churches trial therein.</p>
                  <p>But it is added, if there be more means of diſcovering the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent then one, why ſhould we make one abſolutely neceſſary? <label type="milestone">

And here, I conceive, we differ with none; ſeeing none can deny a conference or mutual diſcourſe to be the beſt means of diſcovering each others minde; for if we call confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence an examination, none (to extend the words of that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gentleman) do ſo much queſtion the conveniency of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as the neceſſity thereof. <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Morris p.</hi> 85.</note>

                  <p>Bur if none may be queſtioned for ignorance, but ſuch as are under a ſuſpition thereof, why do you deſire a conference with <label type="milestone">

                     </label> all? are all under ſuch ſuſpition?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, there are foure ſpecial reaſons aſſigned by us in our <label type="milestone">

                     </label> agreement of this our deſire, 1. That we might the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <note place="margin">In our Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> the ſtate of our flocks. 2. And be the better enabled to edifie the ſame. 3. That we might diſcerne ſuch as are fit, from ſuch as are unworthy of this holy Communion, in point of knowledge. 4. That we might be freeſt from offence, in ſuch our proceedings.</p>
                  <p>The third of theſe reaſons, doth quit from ſuſpecting all of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; for it ſuppoſeth ſome to be worthy in point of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, though others not; and in the laſt reaſon, we intimate this way of conference to be the beſt, and moſt inoffenſive way of putting the difference; as doubtleſſe it is where prejudice rules not; but now, are there not two other reaſons, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to warrant our deſire of conference with the reſt of our people, though not ſuſpected of ignorance, <hi>viz. our knowing their ſtate, and edifying their ſoules?</hi> 'tis one thing to require a conference or an account of knowledge, as a neceſſary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of admiſſion to the Supper; and another thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, as a good and expedient mean of edification; and in this ſenſe, I know, none that in diſpute will deny it, though in practice many do.</p>
                  <p>In this ſenſe, the words of that worthy Gentleman laſt named, are of much weight. <hi>We do not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>altogether diſpute, whether they may call men to examination, as whether it be ſo neceſſary</hi> ratione medii, <hi>ſo as that if they will not come under it, they have power for that cauſe only to keep them from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:118938:158"/> that the Miniſter hath power to deſire the practice of ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a means, is clearly manifeſt, in the very nature and end of his office, in his warrant to do all things to edifying, in his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (if ſo it be) or at leaſt, Apoſtolical practice, in <hi>teaching from houſe to houſe;</hi> and more eſpecially, his having power to cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 6.</note> ſuch, as communicate to him of all good things, where, ſurely, houſe-keepers and grown perſons are not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>But, why then, do we deſire a conference with our people, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> but eſpecially before the adminiſtration of the Supper. Becauſe, 1. This is a more weighty and momentous period of our Chriſtian-Profeſſion, and hath more danger and comfort at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it. 2. Therefore the people have more need of aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for their due preparation, of which this conference is an eſpecial mean. 3. Beſides, now the ſubmiſſion of the better ſort will be ſeaſonably exemplary to draw on the ignorant to this means of their inſtruction and preparation, or elſe detecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſuſpenſion.</p>
                  <p>But then, why do you not conferre with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                     </label> before every particular adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
                  <p>Becauſe our great end of deſiring a conference with the more knowing, is attained by their yielding firſt to confer, <hi>viz.</hi> the <label type="milestone">

                     </label> drawing others on that are more ſuſpicious, by their example. But 2. For ſuch as are found ignorant, we do deſire to confer with them, not only before every Sacrament, but at other times, even until they are better inſtructed and prepared. 3. But in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the reaſon is, becauſe we have laine long in ſome diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and confuſion, and we would endeavour in ſome meaſure for a Reformation, who have ſome hopes, that a labouring to fit our people for a worthy receiving of this ſolemn Supper, may have a general influence upon their lives and converſation, and that if they be once prepared aright for it, we have no reaſon to draw them back, under new ſuſpicious (without new grounds) of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or unworthineſſe.</p>
                  <p>But, a calling all to trial, becauſe ſome are ſuſpected, is, as if <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not ſo, neither really or ſeemingly; if we publiſh, as I ſuppoſe, we do, that we deſire a conference with all, not as if <hi>all</hi> were ſuſpected to be unworthy; but for the other <hi>ends</hi> before ſpecified, and <hi>without which,</hi> indeed, I ſee not, how we can attaine a conference with almoſt any that are truely <hi>ſuſpitious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let me with all meekneſſe and in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt beg, my brethren, that oppoſe us herein, to conſider, what a hard burden they lay upon us, while they tye us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre onely with ſuch, as lie under ſuſpition of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We can do nothing by <hi>force,</hi> or without our peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; then it is moſt likely that if <hi>many</hi> be excuſed, the reſt will think and plead, <hi>Why may not they be excuſed as well as theſe?</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Minister</hi> muſt paſſe a judgement, who are <hi>ſuſpitious,</hi> before he try them; and how that will reliſh, I leave to be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſidered.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Such as are firſt ſuſpected, and upon tryal found to be knowing, will in likelihood hold themſelves much wronged.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. Further, I humbly crave leave, to <hi>offer,</hi> that could we be ſecured of <hi>any</hi> other likely way of bringing the <hi>ſuſpected</hi> to <hi>tryal,</hi> we would no longer preſſe this, as a meane, thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis well known to many, that where conſcience is ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaded againſt it (as ſometimes hath been) we are <hi>here</hi> agreed to hold communion with ſuch as are not ſuſpected, though refuſing to confer with us upon the terms <hi>aforeſaid,</hi> or in order to <hi>admiſſion</hi> to the Sacrament.</p>

                  <p>Thus let us be beleeved to preſſe a <hi>general conference</hi> with our people, onely as a point of great conveniency (as none can doubt it is) and not of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> much leſſe abſolute; as we do not affirme, but indeed denie it to be.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>true reaſon</hi> hereof (I preſume) is, becauſe we take our ſelves to have the <hi>care</hi> of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>flock,</hi> as well as of <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſheep;</hi> and to be obliged to do all things to the <hi>edification</hi> of the whole, as well as of particulars; and we conceive that the <hi>edification</hi> of the whole is more fairly aimed at by requiring this <hi>general conference,</hi> though with the preſent denial of the Supper to ſome <hi>few,</hi> that may be worthy, then by <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> the ſame to ſuch, with the <hi>hazard</hi> of all <hi>order</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Yet, if this conference be ſcrupled at, with <hi>ſeeming ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> there is (as before) proviſion made for the <hi>admiſſion</hi> of ſuch as are <hi>unſuſpected,</hi> without it; but, more plainly, though ſuch, upon the foreſaid gounds, as alſo becauſe of that <hi>liberty,</hi> the Church hath for the choice of <hi>fit</hi> and convenient ſeaſons, may be kept off a <hi>while;</hi> yet, I conceive, if they make a <hi>modeſt</hi> and not a <hi>turbulent</hi> or ſcandalous <hi>claime,</hi> they may not be <hi>totally</hi> or <hi>finally (meerly</hi> for want of <hi>ſubmitting</hi> to <hi>conference,</hi> of which they may alſo ſhew their <hi>reaſons)</hi> be cut off, or denied the Sacrament; prudence, may a <hi>while</hi> with-hold <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> but it cannot for ever diſpoſe of right.</p>

                  <hi>We may not proceed againſt wicked brethren but by diſcipline and cenſures.</hi>

               <p>HItherto of our Churches and Sacraments: ſome few inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more added, touching diſcipline and cenſures, will put a ſpeedy period to the whole.</p>
               <p>Touching cenſures, I inferre, from my great Propoſition thus; If ſaving grace go not into the eſſence of the viſible Church, but <hi>wicked</hi> perſons, and ſuch as as have no <hi>evidence</hi> of ſaving grace, may be truely members of the viſible Church. Then, 1. We may not proceed againſt wicked <hi>Church-members</hi> but by <hi>diſcipline</hi> or cenſure. 2. Nor reckon them without, until they are made ſuch by <hi>cenſure</hi> or <hi>caſt out.</hi> 3. We are bound to proceed againſt <hi>all ſuch</hi> wicked Church-members, in a courſe of <hi>cenſure.</hi> Of theſe in their order.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>We may not proceed againſt wicked Church-members but by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What order hath God left in his Church to keep his Ordinances from contempt. <hi>R.</hi> The unruly ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, the obſtinate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, &amp; the penitent after their fall reſtored and comforted. <hi>Hier</hi> catech. p. 87.</note> 
                  <hi>cenſure.</hi> Suppoſing that we have finiſhed our diſcourſe of the Churches proceedings againſt the ignorant, which is not <hi>by cenſure,</hi> and that we are now conſidering the Churches way of proceeding againſt the wicked, as ſuch, or for their wickedneſs, or their wicked converſation; the ground of this inference is very plaine: for wicked perſons, being ſuppoſed to be <hi>Church-members,</hi> at leaſt, till caſt out; and therefore to be dealt with, onely as ſuch, they are not to be proceeded againſt, but by cenſure; for this reaſon, becauſe the way and the onely way that Chriſt hath appointed and allowed to his Church to proceed in, againſt <hi>all her members</hi> in point of converſation, is the way of <hi>cenſure</hi> or diſcipline; which, I preſume, did never yet
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:118938:160"/> receive a <hi>queſtion,</hi> much leſſe <hi>contradiction</hi> from any <hi>ſober</hi> or <hi>learned</hi> man; and which is abundantly teſtified unto by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal practice of all the Churches; of all the ſeveral <hi>modes</hi> and <hi>formes</hi> of Churches in the world; for what Churches did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proceed againſt any member of her own for ſcandal or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, in any other way but the way of diſcipline or cenſure? or what other way can there be <hi>imagined?</hi> or ventured on, to be <hi>aſſerted?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But what is meant by <hi>cenſure?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Cenſure</hi> here is not taken in the large and broad ſenſe of it, but in its <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> ſenſe, or as it is peculiar to the <hi>Churches juriſdiction,</hi> and properly termed <hi>Church-cenſure,</hi> and it may be defined thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Church-cenſure</hi> is an <hi>inſtrument</hi> of <hi>diſcipline,</hi> whereby <hi>perſonal</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cenſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.</note> 
                  <hi>Application</hi> of the Will of God is made, for the <hi>removing of ſcandals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is an <hi>Instrument of diſcipline,</hi> for <hi>Ames</hi> teacheth, diſcipline is <hi>perſonalis applicatio—per cenſuras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>preaching</hi> of the Word, the Will of God is <hi>really</hi> applied, but yet <hi>generally;</hi> or <hi>indefinitely,</hi> &amp;c. not <hi>perſonally,</hi> in adminiſtring the Sacraments the will of God is perſonally applied alſo, yet by ſeals; but now the Wil of God in the exerciſe of diſcipline is applied by <hi>cenſures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſubject, both of the <hi>ſcandal,</hi> and of the <hi>cenſure,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be in <hi>eccleſia,</hi> or <hi>within,</hi> or a <hi>brother;</hi> if thy <hi>brother,</hi> Mat. 18. 15. and conſequently the <hi>party offended,</hi> and cenſuring, muſt be a brother too.</p>
               <p>The ſinne of a brother <hi>qua ſcandalous</hi> or offenſive is the onely ground, reaſon, and object of this <hi>cenſure,</hi> offend thee, or ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, Mat. 18. 15.</p>
               <p>Now there is no other courſe left by Chriſt, for <hi>brethren</hi> or Church-members, or the Church, as <hi>ſuch,</hi> to recover ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from a brother, but this way of perſonal applying the will of Chriſt unto him (as <hi>Ames</hi> expreſſeth it) but by <hi>cenſures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to make this more evident, and to cut the remaining work <note place="margin">The parts of cenſure.</note> ſhort, let us conſider this diſcipline or cenſure in its parts; which, as <hi>Aimes,</hi> hath laid the diviſion for us, are theſe two fraternal <hi>correption</hi> or admonition and <hi>excommunication.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:118938:160"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Admonition</hi> is taken ſimply, and largely, for a moral duty; as <note place="margin">Admonition twofold, ſimple and reſpective.</note> it is preſſed, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17. and in many other Scriptures; or <hi>respectively</hi> to <hi>excommunication,</hi> or diſcipline, and limited or <hi>reſtrained</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> and grounded upon the poſitive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. the firſt is indeed a perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>application</hi> of <hi>the will of Chriſt,</hi> but no <hi>Church-cenſure;</hi> the laſt is the firſt perſonal application of the Will of Chriſt, by cenſure; or the firſt act or kinde of Church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>Give me leave to note the difference here, (which, I conceive <note place="margin">Simple admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, no Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Becauſe we ſtand obliged to it by the Law of <hi>nature,</hi> but ſo we are not to any part of <hi>Chriſtian-diſcipline,</hi> as ſuch. 2. Therefore <hi>all mankinde</hi> are bound unto it, though <hi>none</hi> but the <hi>Church</hi> have to do with <hi>Eccleſiastical diſcipline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I humbly conceive that this abſolute and moral duty of <note place="margin">Yet it hath its uſe in the Church for ſins of infirmity, which Church cenſuremedleth not with.</note> admonition, hath its uſe in the Church alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>ſinnes of infirmity,</hi> and ſinnes of a weaker and more inconſiderable offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſſe, then to be proceeded againſt by diſcipline (unleſſe <hi>groſſe obſtinacy</hi> be alſo added; which obſtinacy, is, then, the <hi>ſcandal,</hi> and the object of cenſure, rather then the ſinne it ſelf perſiſted in.)

Becauſe, if every ſin of <hi>infirmity</hi> ſhould be the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>admonition,</hi> as a part of Church-diſcipline; we ſhould do almoſt nothing, but <hi>perſecute each other</hi> with renewed, daily, endleſſe and remedileſſe troubles; for all are guilty of ſuch ſinnes; and we muſt judge of <hi>obſtinacy</hi> in ſinne, eſpecially by continuance in it; and ſuch ſinnes are defined to be <hi>quotidianae incurſionis,</hi> and there is no poſſibility of being <hi>throughly</hi> purged from them in this world, and therefore if ſuch ſinnes be the object of <hi>cenſure,</hi> we muſt unavoidably be continually following one another in the <hi>ſteps</hi> of <hi>admonition</hi> to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,</hi> as <hi>obſtinate ſinners.</hi>

               <p> Yet, no doubt, there is <hi>ſuch</hi> a cenſure as <hi>admonition, peculiar</hi>

               <p>This admonition, I terme, <hi>respective unto excommunication;</hi> not becauſe it is in order to it; or if (as <hi>Ames</hi> denieth well) the proper end of admonition were, <hi>ut aditas inde fiat ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicationem;</hi> but rather, <hi>ut excommunicandi neceſſitas, ſi fieri p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p> I grant, that this <hi>admonition</hi> ought to anſwer the <hi>publick</hi> or <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> nature of the <hi>ſcandal,</hi> by being alſo private or publick, yet ſtill admonition is neceſſary; private admonition, and its proceſſes, being grounded and regulated, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15, 16. and <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> admonition, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
               <p>Yea, is there any caſe when admonition is not <hi>ſeaſonable,</hi> and not in prudence to be performed; I ſhall aſſume that in the ſame caſe <hi>excommunication</hi> is to be forborne, if the party have not admoniſh'd before; for ſtill, the <hi>concluſion</hi> is that no perſon is to be proceeded againſt, for <hi>ſcandal,</hi> but this is to begin with <hi>admonition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other <hi>part</hi> of eccleſiaſtical <hi>diſcipline</hi> is called <hi>excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi>

               <p>Now, for ought I can finde, in this caſe of <hi>ſcandal,</hi> there is no <hi>other remedy</hi> left us in <hi>Scripture</hi> after the performance of due ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, but this of <hi>excommunication;</hi> that which ſome term <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion,</hi> and many think moſt properly, <hi>viz.</hi> the holding the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or accuſed perſon in <hi>ſuſpenſe</hi> until he is tried, cannot be reaſonably termed a <hi>cenſure,</hi> or <hi>penalty;</hi> no more then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of a ſuſpected <hi>felon</hi> to the day of <hi>hearing</hi> who may be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.

               <p>The <hi>Scripture</hi> is plaine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and in diverſe other places, that the way of proceeding againſt <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> and wicked perſons in the Church, is to put them away from among us by an eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>judgement, v.</hi> 12, 13. and we read in Scripture of no <hi>other;</hi> and this we call <hi>excommunication.</hi>

               <p>Whereupon, though not ſo <hi>early</hi> (may I not ſay as <hi>wiſely?)</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> afterwards, took up this courſe of <hi>mercy</hi> and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, patience and forbearance in <hi>ejecting,</hi> and indeed abated of the former <hi>rigour,</hi> ſeverity, and zeal, in <hi>readmitting</hi> by ſuch <hi>ſlow degrees:</hi> and who doubts, but that the Goſpel being ſo <hi>rich</hi> in <hi>mercy</hi> and forbearance, and the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> ſtanding in his ſtead, who hath all <hi>fulneſſe of grace,</hi> and every Ordinance being a <hi>mean of ſalvation,</hi> our <hi>liberty</hi> is broader, and our errour leſſe in the wayes of <hi>indulgency</hi> and clemency, then of judgement and puniſhment; the rule of mercy exceeded, is but an errour of <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> whereas exceſſe <hi>in juſtice</hi> proceeds into <hi>injury</hi> and <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</hi>

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:118938:162"/> rejected regularly from the Supper, ſtands excommunicate, though but in part.</p>
               <p>Hence will eaſily flow ſome ſeaſonable intimations, which I crave leave to note only.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It hence then follows, that we (in our Churches) may not reject any of our brethren, from any part of our Church-communion for their converſation-ſake, if they be not liable to cenſure, that is, as before we explained, if they be not guilty of ſome great ſin, and perſiſt therein with obſtinacy; we are taught even from <hi>New-England,</hi> that they proceed not to cenſure, but in caſe of known offence, and ſuch offence as cannot be healed without cenſure; and what Church among the very <hi>Brownists</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> proceeds by any other rule?</p>
               <p>Let us impartially reckon of <hi>ſcandal</hi> and <hi>cenſure</hi> with the Scriprure, either in the <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New</hi> Teſtament? and, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume this matter is ended; we muſt not proceed to ſo high a cenſure as <hi>Excommunication,</hi> upon ſtricter termes then the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> doth, nor take <hi>ſcandal,</hi> as deſerving ſo high a cenſure in a ſtricter <hi>ſenſe</hi> then the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then, to reckon any of our members among <hi>dogges</hi> and <hi>ſwine,</hi> before they have been duly admoniſhed, if not <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated</hi> is <hi>raſh judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Our <hi>provoking</hi> the Gommunicants, when the fault is not known (ſave privately) to make <hi>publick exceptions</hi> againſt the lives or actions of any that deſerve <hi>admiſſion</hi> to the Sacrament, and not rather to put them upon their <hi>proper duty</hi> of <hi>private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition</hi> and <hi>correption,</hi> ſeemeth to croſſe our Saviours directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 15. 5.) in this caſe.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond inference touching Cenſures is this, if wicked men be indeed conſiſtent with viſible Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:118938:163"/> then we may not reckon any member of our Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be without, though wicked and ſcandalous, until he is made ſuch by Church-cenſure, and caſt out.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this connexion is evident; for our Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are true Churches. And ſecondly, the members of true Churches are to be accounted to be within, and not without, until they are <hi>excommunicated</hi> or caſt out, notwithſtanding their <hi>ſcandal.</hi> The <hi>inceſtuous</hi> perſon is an invincible inſtance here; 'tis known that he was very <hi>ſcandalous,</hi> yer 'tis plain he was ſtill within, and accordingly liable to the Churches <hi>judgement,</hi> until caſt out.

               </p>
               <p>But, theſe things have, I hope, been demonſtrated before.

               </head>
               <p>LAſtly, if wickedneſſe or ſcandal render not the members of our Congregations to be no Church-members, then are we not bound to proceed againſt the ſcandalous in our congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by way of cenſure? this is indeed the hardeſt task, but yet it is not a clear duty, and the great and likelieſt remedy of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcandalous, and preſerving the reſt from leaven and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?</p>
               <p>If perſons be ſcandalous, and within, what can free them from Eccleſiaſtical cenſure? or excuſe us from judging them with it? do not ye judge them that are within? <hi>i. e. quatenus</hi> within, and conſequently all that are within? is not Chriſts diſcipline as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive as his Church? or is there any room in his houſe not under his keyes? any Schollar in his School not under his Rod? or any ſubject in his Kingdome not under his power? where then is his glory?</p>
               <p>Yea, do not thoſe forcible and plain commands, Tell thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his fault, and if he hear thee not, tell the Church, and if he hear not the Church, let him be to thee as an <hi>heathen and a publican;</hi> an heretick after the firſt and ſecond admonition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; <hi>In the Name of the Lord Jeſus,—deliver ſuch an one unto Satan; Put away from among your ſelves that wicked perſon, &amp;c.</hi> do not theſe direct and preſſing commands, convince, reprove, rebuke, exhort both Miniſters and people, as with thunder and lightning? doth not the rod of ſeverer diſcipline in the ancient Churches, in more perillous times, laſh our fearfulneſſe, lazineſſe, unbelief and neglects herein?</p>
               <p>The good Lord ſpare and pardon, yet ſhame us, and rowſe us to our duty, that we may no longer conferre with that fleſh and blood that cannot enter into the Kingdome of heaven; tbat the Miniſtry may effectually quicken the people to a regular courſe of admonition; and proceed with them to an high cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:118938:164"/> upon juſt complaints of ſuch as are found obſtinate.</p>
               <p>Certainly, this is the remedy appointed by Chriſt for a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and while this way is obſtructed, either by us, or our people, it is no great wonder, if mens devices, though never ſo handſome, remain ſucceſſeleſs. Here we may ſee with tears in our eyes, and pity and ſorrow in our hearts, the bleſſed childe of Reformation ſtick, notwithſtanding all our care, pains and diligence for ſtrict admiſſions to the Sacraments, or the hot ſeparations of others from our Churches.</p>
               <p>Yet let me not be miſtaken; I know, we ought to proceed in cenſure according to rule, in fit ſeaſon, not when it is like to do no good, in due meaſure; not publikely when the fault is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate in a right manner, with ſhew of love and prudence, and by a perſon that is likelieſt to prevail if the Lord will. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we are not to proceed to excommunication, as before was noted, until obſtinacy appear after admonition; yet though it muſt be done fitly, it muſt be done; though all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces muſt be heeded, the ſubſtance may not be ſleighted; though there muſt be a right object, place, time, meaſure, manner, and perſon obſerved, as near as we can in doing the duty, yet it is ſtill in it ſelf a duty, and to be undertaken by us though it ſeem grievous.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſad to obſerve how froward the ſpirits of moſt are unto a right execution of this great duty; which I muſt have leave to note in a few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are ſome, that hold themſelves obliged to admoniſh <note place="margin">Some will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the Communicants only.</note> ſuch only as are fellow-communicants with them at the Lords Table; and this we have cauſe to bewail as a general errour, though a very great one. Are not the reſt of the Congregation brethren and within, and Church-members as well as the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants? do their prejudices and ſurmizes, againſt the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings about admiſſion, which hinders their preſent communion, or their ſcandalous converſation, deſtroy their Church-relation, and cut off their brotherhood? yea, this Ordinance of brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admonition, the very excommunicate have intereſt in; account him not as an enemy, but admoniſh him as a brother.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others there are, that though they do ſometimes (in a cold <note place="margin">Some admoniſh but look not after the iſſue, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15</note> and careleſſe manner) tell a brother of his fault; yet they look not after the iſſue; they go no further in the way of Chriſt then
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:118938:164"/> this one ſtep; whereas they are charged to expect repentance, or elſe to proceed with a further application, towards excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we might ſit down and weep; this is the great <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora</hi> of Reformation on the peoples part; and their general and deep guilt; for my part, I cannot ſee any ground to hope, for any conſiderable ſueceſſe of diſcipline, until this plain and weighty duty, be wiſely, ſeriouſly, and reſolvedly undertaken by our people, and chearfully and faithfully gone through withal. For, if that famous text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15, 16. were but once ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to write it ſelfe in its power upon our hearts, we ſhould be fully ſatisfied, that all the work of Diſcipline and Church-Reformation doth not lie upon the Miniſters hands.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Above all, thoſe of the people muſt needs be blamed, that <note place="margin">Some expect the Miniſter ſhould do all, and ſeparate for that which is their own fault.</note> are either departed already, or are ſtill threatning to ſeparate from us, becauſe many of our members are ſcandalous. Alas, that ſuch would look throughout the Bible, and ſee that the ſcandal of the brethren is no juſt ground of ſeparation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the true reaſon why our members are ſo ſcandalous, is their own neglect of this duty of Admonition, which ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede their excommunication.</p>
               <p>Had ſuch firſt obſerved their duty, according to the degrees of it enjoyned by Chriſt, and brought the buſineſſe to the hearing of the Church, or but their Miniſter, and then ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed-ſcandalous-obſtinate perſons had been cheriſhed and indulged, and his good and regular endeavours diſcountenanc't; there had been ſome cauſe, indeed, to complain, though not to depart; but, alas, the world knows the matter is otherwiſe. Such perſons, generally, firſt neglect their own duty of admonition, and then, unreaſonably clamour againſt their Miniſter, for either not doing their duty for them. or for ſuffering that which he cannot help, and then labour to ſet all on fire, and run away.</p>
               <p>I had now ended, but that, me thinks, I hear, the people mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure; and ſome of my brethren in the Miniſtry object againſt what hath now been urged.</p>
               <p>The people, I know, are apt to ſay, What, muſt we admoniſh <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                  </label> all that are ſcandalous? why, this is to bring the world about our ears. Beſides, many are dogs and ſwine, and we muſt not caſt <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 6.</note> our pearls before ſwine, nor give holy reproof unto dogs.</p>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:118938:165"/>
               <p> But ſuch may be eaſily anſwered, though hardly ſatisfied. Let us do our duty, and though the heavens fall we ſhall catch no harme: who is he that ſhall harme you, if ye be followers of that which is good. How ſafe is that ſoul that commits it ſelfe in well-doing into the hands of a faithful Creator! how happy is he, whom when the great Maſter cometh, he ſhall finde ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the midſt of a people ſo careleſſe of this great duty!</p>
               <p>Again, how do we know our brethren to be dogs and ſwine, before we have tried and found them ſuch, by their evil enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the pearle of admonition, and the holy thing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; but ſuppoſe the worſe, thy labour of duty to Chriſt, and love to thy brother is not wholly loſt; for thou haſt prepared him for a further Ordinance appointed by Chriſt, for his repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, recovery and ſalvation, <hi>viz.</hi> the admonition of the Church and Excommunication.</p>
               <p>That which ſome of my brethren are apt to ſay, me thinks is <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                  </label> this, That the Cenſures ſo much preſſed ſeems contrary to the general practice of the Miniſters, who only ſuſpend the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous from the Supper of the Lord and do not excommunicate any.</p>
               <p>True, I chooſe rather to terme this cenſure, excommunication <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> or a rejecting and caſting out; but for no other reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, thus it ſeemeth more warrantable from Scripture. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the true meaning of the word <hi>[Suſpenſion]</hi> is in controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; And 3. This term of [ſuſpenſion] in this ſenſe, ſeemeth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive to ſome brethren. And I intend it in no other ſenſe then <hi>Ameſius</hi> doth, upon the head of Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline; where lie purpoſely treats of excommunication, and calleth Suſpenſion from the Supper, &amp;c. <hi>Excommunicatio minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, that which I have ſo much preſſed under the name of Excommunication, is no other thing then that which other brethren call ſuſpenſion. And provided, that this ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be intended, and regularly proceeded unto as a Church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, diſtinct from the ſuſpenſion of the ignorant; which is no cenſure (and which we have debated before.) Me thinks this might at leaſt for the preſent ſuffice us. Conſidering.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all do maintain without difference that uſpenſion from the Supper, is a neceſſary and main part of the greater excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, grounded on all thoſe Scriptures, that warrant that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:118938:165"/> greater cenſure. 'Tis therfore alſo called <hi>Excommunicatiominor</hi> (as before) as the firſt degree of the cenſure among the Jews, <hi>Nid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dai,</hi> was.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Many learned and reverend men affirm, that the greater excommunication it ſelf, doth not debar men of any other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Cottons</hi> way of N. E. p. 39, 40<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> Ordinance, beſides the Supper.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So far, we may proceed, as to caſt perſons out of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Supper, and yet keep our ſelves and the perſon cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſafe from the Law of the Land; and ſome think, no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And if the word [Excommunication] ſhould offend the Law, (it being not Scripture-word) may be forborn or changed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But principally, though our Miniſterial authority may be larger, yet our power can extend no fatther, as things now are; for the Church or place of aſſembling, is a place of common Civil right; ſo that though we ſhould ſentence a ſcandalous perſon, unfit for communion with us in all Ordinances; yet he may come in to the common place of divine worſhip, and joyn with us in the Word and Prayer, and do body can hinder him, without doing him civil wrong, by entrenching on his property, and ſhutting his own door upon him.</p>
               <p>I humbly preſent this, to be ſeriouſly conſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, I commend it to the conſideration of thoſe other brethren that do ſo vehemently preſs us ro excommunicate the ſcandalous from all Ordinances, and the very place of divine worſhip. I cannot then ſee how we can well avoid one of theſe two great inconveniences; either to withhold the civil right of ſuch perſons from them; or to put the whole Church out of the Synagogue, and to betake our ſelves moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniently to a private houſe.</p>

               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:118938:166"/>
               <p> But it may be with great weight, and ſeriouſneſſe queſtioned, <label type="milestone">

               <p>I dare not determine how far this is the caſe of ſome pariſhes, eſpeciallie where the people are generally looſe, and diſaffected to their Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Yet, I conceive, that moſt Congregations are made up of three ſorts of people. 1. A middle, moderate and well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> people, that uſually joyne with their Miniſter, or differ from him conſcientiouſly and modeſtly. 2. People upon two extreams, ſome too large in their principles, that ſet themſelves to oppoſe every thing tending to Order and Reformation, under the notion of Novelty and Tyranny. Some again more too ſtrict, that make it their buſineſſe to cenſure every thing, that cometh not fully to the height of their own principles.</p>
               <p>There is but little fear, that the firſt peaceable and moderate ſort, will be offended at the cenſuring of the ſcandalous.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort, indeed, may be offended by diſcipline; and yet I hope, there are but few (for examination of knowledge offendeth moſt) and theſe few are not very apt to ſeparation neither.</p>
               <p>The laſt ſort, they indeed are apteſt to ſeparate; but the want (and not the practice) of diſcipline, is likelieſt to offend them, and occaſion or further their ſeparation, as experience witneſſeth.</p>
               <p>And I cannot but note, for my own, and for my brethrens comfort, that whereas it is moſt ſpeciouſly and vigorouſly obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by ſome, that our ſtirring about diſcipline, hath offended the people and made them to ſeparate; it may be yet obſerved, that but few, if any of thoſe, that are enemies to diſcipline, are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from us; and generally, ſuch as are already ſeparated, or ſuch as are likely yet to ſeparate, are ſuch as complain, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is not ſtricter then it is, or then it ſhould be.</p>
               <p>Now as for theſe, I fear, they will be gone, when we have yielded all we can to hold them: O that tears could quench this diſtempered zeal of men, enflamed after meaſures of purity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attainable, or, if to be attained, inconſiſtent, with the truth of God, or the peace and unity of his Churches.</p>

            <p>Here firſt it may be noted that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> makes it onely a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>expediency,</hi> not <hi>neceſſity.</hi> 2.

            <p>Neither, fourthly, do I think <hi>confirmation</hi> to be of ſo abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as that in no caſe a perſon might proceed into the higher <note place="margin">

            <p n="1">1. Should ſuch a thing be affirmed by any, as I hope it is not,
<pb facs="tcp:118938:174"/> or at leaſt not meant) it is not eaſie to perceive what a heavy charge of groſſe uſurpation is laid upon many of the Churches of Chriſt thereby, where the Ordinance of <hi>confirmation</hi> was never in uſe, and yet the Ordinance of the Supper of the Lord ever ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated</p>
            <p>The <hi>Centuriſts</hi> tell us, that of <hi>confirmation</hi> after <hi>baptiſme</hi> there <note place="margin">

            <p>And 'tis very evident by the complaints of many of the moſt eminent Reformed Divines, and their wiſhings for it, that <hi>Confirmation</hi> is not all in practice with them.</p>
            <p>And though there was the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>ſhadow</hi> of it formerly in <hi>England,</hi> yet the learned Doctor <hi>Hamond</hi> complaineth of its ſleight and perfunctory managing; and deſires, that therefore it might univerſally be done over again.

            <p>The way and meanes for the Church to diſcover this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or ability of her members by, (for of that we are about) is uſually called <hi>catechizing, examination,</hi> or <hi>conference;</hi> or ſome of theſe made more ſolemne, by that Ordinance we are now about, <hi>viz. confirmation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some one of theſe, I think; is <hi>neceſſary</hi> though not in ſo high a degree as the former, yet not neceſſary. 1.

Nor yet neceſſary, by any <hi>expreſſe command</hi> in order to the letting perſons into <hi>profeſſion</hi> of it. 4. But yet neceſſary, with a neceſſity reſulting from that <hi>care</hi> which the Church ſhould have of <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinance, as alſo of her own children; leaſt ſhe ſhould give the Sacrament to thoſe, whom the Lord denieth it; and leaſt ſhe ſuffer what ſhe may help, <hi>viz.</hi> her <hi>members to eat their own judgement;</hi> and this I conceive is not onely <hi>allowed,</hi> but required of the Church by <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Scriptures,</hi> requiring all things to be done <hi>to edifying;</hi> and <hi>faithfully diſpenſed.</hi>

            <pb facs="tcp:118938:175"/>
            <p> 1. That the Lords Supper is part of Gods worſhip, <note place="margin">

            <p>2. That the Ordinances of worſhip are <hi>more neceſſary</hi> then thoſe of diſcipline.</p>

            <p>4. Laſtly, therefore perſons may ſometimes be <hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to the <hi>Lords</hi> Supper, and have a true <hi>right</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (which is no doubt an Ordinance of Worſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But more <hi>particularly,</hi> I conceive that <hi>confirmation</hi> is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary <note place="margin">Confirmation not neceſſary in three caſes.</note> to a perſons <hi>proxime</hi> right in the Lords Supper, eſpecially in <hi>three</hi> caſes.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But if confirmation be a <hi>neceſſary ingredient</hi> to a proxime right in the Lords Supper, how can it be ſupplied? or how can a perſon have ſuch a right without it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Therefore it may be remembred that confirmation
<pb facs="tcp:118938:176"/> (or examination) giveth no right at all to the perſon; it <note place="margin">Confirmation giveth no right</note> onely <hi>evidenceth</hi> and <hi>confirmeth</hi> his former right, and lets him into poſſeſſion, by admiſſion to the Sacrament; the perſon, if ſelf-examined, hath right, according to the word before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 28.</note> and by confirmation, or approving of the Church hath, indeed, that which is called an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> right, yet very improperly; it being onely an evidencing and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying of the former right which before he had as to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>conſcience,</hi> now in the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> for, no man can convey a title to Gods Ordinances. We muſt hold the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt the means of <hi>conveying</hi> aright, which here is ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>examination; and the meanes of <hi>diſcovering</hi> this right, and giving <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> which is Church-examination, approbation, or if you will, <hi>confirmation;</hi> which, I conceive, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be ſubmitted to by the people, when it is required; but not any neceſſary ingredient into any thing of their right or title to any Ordinance. Confirmation, when it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is neceſſary to poſſeſſion, but not to right in the Lords Supper; but when not required, neceſſary to neither; for if the Miniſters neglect their duty in not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>equiring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be confirmed, there is no reaſon the people ſhould be kept from the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which is doubtleſſe a <hi>clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> duty; and a better meanes of the peoples <hi>confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> then that which hath appropriated the name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, I conceive confirmation (or examination) is not ſo neceſſary, <hi>when the end is attained before without it;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">When the end is otherwiſe attained.</note> 
               <hi>Diſcipline</hi> is no farther a duty then it is a <hi>meanes;</hi> and <hi>meanes,</hi> as ſuch, are onely <hi>neceſſary</hi> for the attaining their <hi>ends;</hi> therefore, where the end is attained unto, there is (no doubt) leſſe need of the <hi>meanes;</hi> thus, where a diſcovery of a perſons grace, and knowledge, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for the Sacrament, the ends of confirmation, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained (as it ſometimes is) by other meanes; there, I conceive, that confirmation is not abſolutely neceſſary to the letting in of a perſon to <hi>poſſeſſe</hi> his right in the Lords Supper it being no more required for the ſaid ends, then any <hi>other meanes</hi> conducing thereunto, onely as it is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:118938:176"/> meanes, and in it ſelfe more likely and apt to obtaine them.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, I conceive, that confirmation not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">When likely to do hurt.</note> neceſſary to be uſed, but may and ought to be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with, when the <hi>putting it in practice is likely to do more hurt then good, viz.</hi> when upon a ſerious conſideration of the peoples jealouſies, prejudices, or any other kinde of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers upon them, it is rationally judged, that ſeeming new, and great, and ſolemne undertaking will rather make ſome violent diſturbance, rupture, or ſchiſme among them, and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate their hearts and perſons further from us, then any way, better reform, or order them.</p>
            <p>The Churches in <hi>Switzerland</hi> ſee much in that of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> that ſometimes the <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> of the people is ſuch, that they are not <hi>fit for diſcipline,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thought the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaw the ſame in the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth;</hi> God grant we may not too ſoone have cauſe of the ſame complaint in <hi>England;</hi> eſpecially, as to ſo ſolemne an Ordinance of diſcipline, and ſo little (as yet) underſtood by the people, as confirmation is; where a medicine is like to do good, 'tis folly to omit it; but where it is likely to hurt, 'tis folly, I think, to apply it; eſpecially after we have tried ſomewhat already of a very like nature to the ſame ſore, with but indifferent or bad ſucceſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be ſaid, that, if confirmation be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by God in Scripture, it may in no caſe be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I think the rule holdeth not to any part of <hi>diſcipline,</hi> as diſcipline oppoſed to <hi>doctrine</hi> and worſhip; a reproving our brother, or telling him his fault, is more <hi>clearly</hi> commanded then confirmation; yet in ſome caſes, this is to be diſpenſed with, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 7.</p>
            <p>2. But ſecondly, confirmation as now deſired, I think is not to <note place="margin">Confirmation not expreſſe in Scripture, or ancient church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</note> be found in any expreſſe <hi>command,</hi> or <hi>example</hi> in <hi>Scripture;</hi> or, indeed, the <hi>ancient</hi> Churches.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118938:177"/>
            <p> Confirmation may bee lookt on in <hi>three</hi> ſpecial periods. Firſt, as it was in the times of the Apoſtles. Secondly, as it was in the times next the Apoſtles. 3. As in times <hi>near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Firſt, in the times of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> I do yet beleeve <note place="margin">Confirmation as uſed by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</note> that confirmation was nothing elſe but <hi>impoſition of hands</hi> (with prayer) on perſons, without exacting any Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting or profeſſion of the faith in order thereunto, that they might receive the <hi>extraordinary</hi> gifts of the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the holy Ghoſt himſelfe hath interpreted it, in <hi>Acts</hi> 19. <hi>verſe</hi> 6. when <hi>Paul had laid his hands upon them, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt came on them, and they ſpake with tongues and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied;</hi> and why it ſhould not be thus underſtood (whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a <hi>learned</hi> man conceiveth to the contrary) in <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 17. I ſee no reaſon, conſidering the phraze, <hi>verſe</hi> 16. <hi>[as yet the holy Ghoſt was fallen upon none but them;]</hi> a phraze, I think, peculiar to the <hi>extraordinary</hi> deſcentions of him in thoſe dayes; as alſo that had been onely to have ſtrangthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the truth againſt perſecution, as <hi>Simon</hi> could hardly, or not ſo eaſily have ſeene <hi>that</hi> ſo preſently, as <hi>v.</hi> 18. ſo would he ſcarcely have thought it worth his money, wherewith he thought to have purchaſed <hi>that gift of God, verſe</hi> 19, 20.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>extraordinary</hi> ſenſe of the holy Ghoſt, I am alſo apt to conceive of <hi>impoſition of hands,</hi> Heb. 6. 2. (with great reſpect to that moſt ingenious and elegant gloſſe of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend authour of the <hi>firſt Epistle</hi> to the <hi>exercitation;)</hi> yea, from this very Text, I humbly conceive, the <hi>Ancients</hi> took their uſual formes of ſpeech, of enlightening, and <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the holy Ghoſt;</hi> referring the firſt to baptiſme, and the laſt to <hi>laying on of hands;</hi> and truely, methinks, this ſame reference is even percevable in the Text it ſelfe; [being <note place="margin">
                  <hi>vid.</hi> Heb. 6. 2, 4</note> once enlightened] ſeeming to relate to Baptiſmes; and [being made partakers of the holy Ghoſt] to <hi>laying on</hi> of <hi>hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118938:177"/>
            <p> 2. Secondly if we look upon <hi>laying on of hands,</hi> as it was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">Confirmation as uſed in times next the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</note> in the times, <hi>next</hi> and immediately <hi>after the Apoſtles;</hi> or as ſoone as we reade of its uſe in the Churches after the times of the Apoſtles; we finde not, that I can yet diſcerne, any <hi>examinations</hi> or <hi>confeſſions,</hi> immediately preceding it, or coming between <hi>baptiſme</hi> and it; we do not finde that children were called at ripeneſſe of age to ratifie what had been promiſed by the ſuſſeptors on their behalf at their infant-baptiſme; we do not finde that children borne in the Church, and <hi>baptized</hi> in infancy, were after baptiſme ſtiled <hi>catechumeni;</hi> or confirmed, when they came to yeares of diſcretion to anſwer for themſelves; much leſſe in that great and ſolemne way wherein we are now deſirous to do it.</p>
            <p>Onely this we finde that generally ſuch as were <hi>baptiſed,</hi> were confirmed <hi>immediately after their baptiſme;</hi> in which confirmation, the party was preſumed to <hi>receive the holy Ghoſt by prayer and impoſition of the hands of the Biſhop;</hi> all which is moſt eaſie to evidence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Biſhop</hi> onely might lay on hands in this work they thought, becauſe none but the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did (<note n="a" place="margin">

            <p>Wherefore methinks <hi>Rivet,</hi> and <hi>Ames,</hi> and <hi>Chamier,</hi> had great
<pb facs="tcp:118938:178"/> reaſon to judge as they did, <hi>viz.</hi> that the laying on of hands in the ancient Churches, was not an Ordinance, much leſſe a Sacrament diſtinct from Baptiſme, but a thing <hi>annex'd</hi> unto it; eſpecially, for that nothing of ſo great a moment as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is, might be done in the Church, whether by ſuch as had power to do it, or ſuch as had none, without the conſent and hand of the Biſhop, for the ratifying of <hi>baptiſme</hi> in caſe it was diſpenſed by ſuch as had no power; and otherwiſe, for the unity of the Church, the honour of its <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the giving, as before, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry notes.</p>
            <p>Now, if I do underſtand my <hi>authour,</hi> he will hardly allow of any thing in theſe primitive practices, ſave the ceremony of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the laying on of hands now, in order to the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Holy Ghoſt, in the firſt extraordinary way ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of Chriſt in <hi>Scripture,</hi> our Authour hath given his ſenſe of it in theſe words. <q>This expreſſion (ſaith he) of giving and receiving the holy Ghoſt was ſtill continued and made uſe of, becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles by impoſition of hands did conferre the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, which though none after their time did or could do, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And for the practice of the Churches afterwards; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming even Infants immediately after Baptiſme; confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Adult, without exacting any new confeſſions in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto; reſtraining the work of confirmation onely to the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or making confirmation onely a <hi>Ceremonial right of Baptiſme,</hi> as <hi>Ames</hi> affirmes the Churches of old did for many ages together; indeed I know not which part here mentioned, either our Authour, or any other late Patron of this excellent Ordinance of confirmation, would adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or not reject.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Laſtly, let us briefly conſider <hi>confirmation</hi> as uſed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſired, by the Churches of Chriſt of <hi>later</hi> yeares, and we may yet more eaſily perceive both its great <hi>unlikeneſſe</hi> to that of old, and its great aptneſſe and <hi>likelineſſe</hi> to prove, if
<pb facs="tcp:118938:178"/> 
               <hi>fixed</hi> upon its right <hi>baſis,</hi> and intended to its juſt <hi>ends,</hi> a moſt excellent and profitable <hi>right</hi> of the Churches of Chriſt in the <hi>later</hi> ages.</p>
            <p>Confirmation in this moderne ſenſe (pardon the expreſſion) <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Waldenſes, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chemniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ns, Bullinger; Pareus.</hi> Three ſpecial ends of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> ſeems to be deſired, for three moſt ſpecial <hi>ends</hi> and uſes, all which may ſeeme to be carried in the very word it ſelfe, namely that the baptiſme, the graces, and laſtly, the <hi>proxime<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> right</hi> of the party in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> might hereby be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and is principally intended for ſuch as being baptized in their <hi>infancy</hi> (not excluding others) and being grown to years of diſcretion in the Church, are <hi>competentes,</hi> or deſire to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <note place="margin">1. To confirm baptiſme.</note> with the Church in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> or any other high pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge hitherto denied them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, ſuch are therefore now to be called to <hi>confirme</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly and in their own perſons, that which their <hi>ſuſſeptors</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for them at their firſt <hi>infant-baptiſme;</hi> according to our own <hi>Lyturgy</hi> (noted by our Authour) <hi>Confirmation</hi> (ſaith it) ought to be obſerved, becauſe when children come to riper age, and ſhall learne what, and how great things their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers did in their name promiſe in baptiſme; they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>[ipſi proprio ore, proprio concenſu, publice eadem agnoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, another great end and uſe of confirmation to <note place="margin">2. To confirm grace.</note> ſuch, is that by meanes of this ſolemne profeſſion, together with the publick earneſt prayers of the Church, the graces of the pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſon may be ſtrengthened and <hi>confirmed;</hi> or that he <note place="margin">

               </note> may receive the grace of <hi>confirmation;</hi> let there ſaith <hi>(Clem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius)</hi> be publick prayer made for the children (that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd that God by his holy ſpirit would vouchſafe to guide, preſerve and confirme them in this profeſſion; therefore the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> appoint confirmation to be done in <hi>ſtabilitatem &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmationem fidei.</hi> Now this is <hi>Gods act</hi> properly; as the firſt was the parties own.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:118938:179"/> 3. The third and laſt great uſe of this Ordinance is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare <note place="margin">To confirm right in the Supper.</note> and confirme the <hi>parties proxime and immediate right</hi> in the Lords Supper, &amp;c. which the party had before, <hi>indeed</hi> by <hi>inward qualifications,</hi> or at leaſt appeared ſo to have by a <hi>good profeſſion;</hi> this now is more properly the <hi>Churches act;</hi> and that which, me thinks, is a great deale more intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe that ſtrive hardeſt after this Ordinance, then the <hi>two former,</hi> eſpecially by our <hi>Authour;</hi> hereby the party is admitted out of the <hi>Infant</hi> into the <hi>Adult estate,</hi> and received into <hi>full communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By confirmation, ſay the Waldenſes, is forthwith given <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Confirmatione protinus data eſt, &amp;c. Nemo ad ſacro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Sanctam com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munionem priu admittatur quam &amp; cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſmum dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerit &amp; confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matus ſit.</hi>
               </note> full power of communicating in the body and blood of Chriſt with all the faithful; for none, according to our own <hi>Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, is to be admitted to the holy communion before he hath learned his catechiſme, and be confirmed, viz. in his right therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for confirmation as to theſe <hi>three laſt uſes;</hi> for which it is now <hi>onely deſired.</hi> I ſhall crave leave to ſignifie <hi>mine opinion</hi> very briefly of.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I conceive, it is not to be found in <hi>expreſſe command</hi> or <hi>example,</hi> or in any expreſſe mention or words in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; what the confirmation of Apoſtolical practice was, we have already noted, and yet I beleeve it was not like to this.</p>
            <p>Secondly, though the eminently Learned and judicious <hi>Calvine,</hi> and ſome other very worthy Divines, are very peremptory, that <hi>this kinde</hi> of confirmation was in uſe in the <hi>Ancient</hi> Church; I confeſſe though I have earneſtly ſought it, and deſired to ſee it, in ſome ancient Writer, I could never yet be made ſo happy; neither did I ever yet ſee any words cited, or pretended to be cited, out of any ſuch <hi>ancient</hi> Authour, that did offer any thing like it; viz. <hi>the admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch as were baptized in Infarcy, when growne of age up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their perſonal publick profeſſion and engagement into farther communion with the Church, by the coremony of impoſition of hands and prayer.</hi> What the ancient confirmation was, hath been already intimated.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118938:179"/>
            <p> Thirdly, yet I rejoyce to acknowledge, that this <hi>moderne confirmation</hi> for the three great uſes mentioned, is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable to the <hi>common principles</hi> of nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but that likewiſe it is <hi>juxta conſenſum Scripturae,</hi> according to the conſent of Scripture, as <hi>Chemnitius</hi> teacheth.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, which <hi>conſent</hi> of Scripture hereunto, is, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not onely <hi>negative,</hi> but <hi>poſitively</hi> given in ſuch <hi>general commands,</hi> as require all Church-diſpenſations, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely thoſe of <hi>diſcipline,</hi> to be directed and leveld at edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for, I doubt not, but, that ſuch a confirmation may be piouſly uſed, and to the <hi>edification</hi> of the Church; as <hi>Chemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> alſo affirmeth;) as a meanes moſt happily accommodated to this great end.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, therefore, I muſt have leave to ſay that I verily beleeve, after theſe my ſmall endeavours upon the point; that our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and moſt Worthy Father [Maſter <hi>Hughes]</hi> hath <hi>hit</hi> the very <hi>white:</hi> and that if this kinde of <hi>confirmation,</hi> which is now ſought for, or that way of <hi>examination</hi> which many pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, by ſome alſo termed a little more mildly, a miniſter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al <hi>conference,</hi> which are all one for ſubſtance, cannot ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>his</hi> (or ſuch like) <hi>grounds,</hi> they will ſtand <hi>no where,</hi> but muſt <hi>fall</hi> at laſt.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, moreover were the late <hi>ſuperſtitions</hi> and <hi>formallity</hi> removed (as all good men muſt needs wiſh) and the ſtated effects and <hi>proviſoes</hi> allowed, (as I cannot but deſire) and the <hi>preſent ſeaſon</hi> and temper of our people duely conſidered, and found to be receptable of it, (which <hi>I</hi> am willing to hope) <hi>I</hi> do here moſt ſolemnly judge that confirmation might prove, through divine mercy, a moſt effectual mean, as of the edification of the Church, ſo of <hi>reconciliation</hi> of the much to be lamented differing brethren; and therefore to be both <hi>piouſly</hi> and <hi>charitably</hi> deſired; and not onely coldly and faintly to be wiſhed, but by all the lovers of truth and peace, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly prayed for, and ſeriouſly endeavoured, both as a moſt needful and ſeaſonable Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, yea, though after all due paines and endeavours uſed; we ſhould not be able to reconcile our principles in
<pb facs="tcp:118938:180"/> every point; if, yet we can meet in the ſame practice about <hi>confirmation,</hi> though on ſome ſmall <hi>differing grounds;</hi> why may not the Church be happily <hi>edified,</hi> and the <hi>peace</hi> thereof in a meaſure obtained by ſuch an unity, <hi>uniformity</hi> in <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;</hi> while the perſons differing but in <hi>lighter</hi> matters, may wait upon the Lord in this <hi>good ſervice</hi> for the great bleſſing of <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity,</hi> promiſed alſo.</p>
            <p>May it be ſtill provided, (I humbly offer) firſt that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation be not thought to have any <hi>ingrediency</hi> into the <hi>nature</hi> or being of our memberſhip. Secondly, that the <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the people</hi> be found ſuch, as will admit of ſuch a change, without any dangerous diſturbance among them, threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening more hurt, then ſober men can rationally expect advantage to the Church thereby; theſe, methinks, have ſome weight in them, and may not be reckoned among the lighter matters.</p>
            <p>8. Laſtly, for the <hi>Ceremony of impoſition of hands,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beleeve it to be ſo neceſſary as the ſubſtance of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, alre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dy declared, is; though, with <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> I doubt not but it may be added here, without <hi>ſuperſtition;</hi> eſpecially when the ſubſtance of the work ſhall rather receive ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and reverence, then diſgrace or prejudice thereby, as <hi>Calvine</hi> intimates it did of old; to the end this action (ſaith he) which otherwiſe ought deſervedly to be eſteemed grave and holy, might have the more reverence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quo autem haec actio, &amp;c.</hi> Inſt. l. 4. c. 19. ſ. 4</note> the Ceremony alſo of impoſition of hands was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it.</p>
            <p>After the Learned Doctor <hi>Hackwell,</hi> I am apt to judge, this ceremony of laying on of hands to ariſe from <hi>natures fountaine,</hi> and thence to ſpread it ſelf over all the world by <hi>univerſal cuſtome.</hi> Man-kinde, being, as it were, prompted by nature to ſolemnize any great honour to be conferred on a perſon, with this ceremony; both <hi>Jew and Greek;</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of God have taken it into <hi>common practice;</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all ſch occaſions; as is moſt apparent both in <hi>prophane</hi> and <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> hyſtory is. And upon this ground with ſome ſpecial alluſion to the <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> (who its like took it up from the former <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>univerſal cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:118938:180"/> with Jewes and Gentiles, when they <hi>conferr'd the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt;</hi> I preſume the Churches afterward annex'd it as a right to <hi>confirmation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, if this kinde of confirmation be not found in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> this right of it, <hi>impoſition of hands</hi> as relating to it cannot be found there; wherefore, we can onely ſay this of it, that it is a decent, <hi>eccleſiaſtical ceremony</hi> (as <hi>Luther</hi> calls it,) ſolemne and laudable, and very fit to be added in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, when <hi>general</hi> prejudice, or any other <hi>extraordinary</hi> impediment doth not prohibit it, or when it is not likely to <hi>loſe its end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We propoſe two ends, at preſent, of ſetting up the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice <note place="margin">Two ends of now de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Firſt, whether <hi>impoſition</hi> of hands added in confirmation by us, now, may not <hi>grate</hi> upon <hi>popular prejudice,</hi> and hinder, ſomewhat, the <hi>firſt</hi> of our <hi>ends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> whether ſome <hi>worthy brethren,</hi> who do not at all ſcruple the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the action, but are haply ready to joyne with us in it; yet, becauſe they ſee not that impoſition of hands was ever uſed but but by a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> may not be ſtricken off fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from us, ſhould we venture upon it; and thus far we ſhould faile of the other of our ends.</p>
            <p>I dare conclude that neither of thoſe two great patrons of confirmation, <hi>Calvine</hi> or <hi>Chemnitius</hi> doth lay ſuch a <hi>ſtreſſe</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on impoſition of hands therein, but that the ſubſtance of the <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> being ſolemnly practiced, this <hi>ceremony</hi> of laying on of hands, in ſuch a caſe as was now propoſed, may, yea <hi>ought</hi> to be <hi>omitted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had thought to have added a <hi>fifth proviſo;</hi> namely, that <hi>the children of ſuch as are baptized,</hi> and do uſually joyne with us <note place="margin">

               <hi>baptized by vertue of their parents memberſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus hence, we might be bold to <hi>reaſon:</hi> where there is mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip in the <hi>parent,</hi> there the <hi>childe</hi> may be baptized; if chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are to be baptized by <hi>vertue</hi> of their <hi>parents memberſhip.</hi> But there is <hi>memberſhip</hi> in ſuch parents as are baptized, and not excommunicated, nor to be excommunicated; Therefore the children of ſuch parents may be baptized, and that <hi>regularly as</hi>
